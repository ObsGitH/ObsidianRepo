### Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
#### Principal 1 - Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.

- People are emotional creatures full of prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
- **Do not criticize, condemn or complain**. Even if you are right, these things will hurt the person's ego and the result is that they will rationalize their behavior and justify themselves with some bullshit logic and resent and condemn you in return. Instead, put yourself in their shoes and figure out why they did what they did because this will be the key to figuring out their prejudices, vanities and what they take pride in. This will ultimately allow to control them as you wish, allowing you to make them feel whatever emotion you want and driving them to take whatever action you want.
#### Principal 2 - Give honest and sincere appreciation.
- The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want. What do you want? (I need to figure this question out always). The deepest urge in human nature is **“the desire to be important."**
	- About the topic this is a list of things that all people desire most to least :1. Health and the preservation of life.2. Food.3. Sleep.4. Money and the things money will buy.5. Life in the hereafter.6. Sexual gratification.7. The well-being of our children.8. A feeling of importance. Always keep check if the people that you interact with are lacking any of these and use their **deprivation to make them want to do something that is useful to you**
	- The desire to be important can be understood as the **desire to be appreciated**. **People have a insatiable craving to be complimented.** Giving people compliments/appreciating them will make them be on the palm of your hand, but they need to be genuine compliments. 
		- For a compliment to be genuine it needs to feel 1. Unprompted(giving the impression that they were generated expontaneously) 2. Honest 3.Somewhat Rare(Showering people with compliments will make them weary of your manipulative intentions.); to achieve this you need to say something that is true about that person and that they know is true. A runner is great at running and he knows it, some people don't know they are good at some things and complementing them at that will make them feel like you are being dishonest. Try to find something a more conceived trait/accomplishment as well otherwise it will be perceived as **flattery**, figure out some "hidden" talent/quality of this runner and complement him on his "positive attitude towards life" or something - if he has a positive attitude towards life. 
		- Best case cenario is to find a talent/quality that will generate a compliment that will make the person want to do something that you want them to do. Situation: a girl in your university group is not giving here all and possibly failing at here assigment. One solution would be to complement her on how "perceptive she is" (as long as it is true) which you make her want to focus on her assigment to prove this talent/quality that I attributed to her in order to reafirm her own importance/appreciation to herself, to make herself proud to be "perceptive" and ultimately achieve your goals.
			- **Do not mistake a compliment for flattery**: In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else. The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned. **Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.**
	- **If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.**
	- People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance. Invalid in the sense that they will make themselves be perceived as weaker, less capable or incapable, frail, dumb, etc. in order to harness some attention and sympathy. **Women do this A LOT.** : can pick you this up for me? Omg I'm so dumb lol? How does this work...can you tell me?
	- **People may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality.** This frase feels awfully familiar to me, I think I am in the process of becoming insane exactly for this reason. I WILL NOT GO INSANE.
		- If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation.
- I should be hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise. I should be anxious to praise people but loath to find fault in them."
- “Every man I meet is my superior to me in some way, In that, I learn of him.”
#### Principal 3 - Arouse in the other person an eager want.
- “Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire . . . and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”
- “How can I make this person want to do it?”
- “If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
- Nobody cares about what I desire they, just like me, only care about what they desire.
- All of us are eternally interested in solving our own problems.
- Instead of figuring out what someone desires and giving them that in way that also makes them do what you want. You can also convince people that something that you want them to do is desirable for them (regardless of this being true or not), the result is the same.
- “People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”
- "self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why can’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; their pride will make them like it and think that it is important which will guarantee their engagement with whatever product/action/idea/emotion "they came up with".

### Ways To Make People Like You

#### Principle One - Become genuinely interested in other people. 
- You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves - morning, noon and after dinner. When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do you look for first?
-  “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.” 
- I am grateful because these people come to see me, They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.”  This was the secret of the greatest American magician to make people fall in love with him. (he could be lying and using that lie to make you and other people like him more.  I would be weary of somebody like him, But it doesn't matter as long as he did it sucessfully and made most people not be weary of him I am weary of him right now.)
- Any person likes people who admire them. Including me.
- “We are interested in others when they are interested in us." 

#### Principal Two - Smile
- “People who smile,” he said, “tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There’s far more information in a smile than a frown. That’s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.”
- people rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.
- You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.
- “I soon found that everybody was smiling back at me, I treat those who come to me with complaints or grievances in a cheerful manner, I smile as I listen to them and I find that adjustments are accomplished much easier. I find that smiles are bringing me dollars, many dollars every day.
- “Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.
- Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. What you are thinking is what determines if you will be happy or unhappy.
- “There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.” - Shakespeare
-  “when a boy realizes that he is going to be a cripple for life, he is shocked at first; but after he gets over the shock, he usually resigns himself to his fate and then becomes as happy as normal boys.”
	- This is very interesting. It means that if I can crush somebody's hope completely they will resign from rebelling and will accept their fate(what I planned for them).

#### Principal 3 - Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 


#### Principal 4 - Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
- “Few human beings,” wrote Jack Wood ford in Strangers in Love, “few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention.” I went even further than giving him rapt attention. I was “hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” 
- “They have been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open. . . . Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait ."
- If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.
	- People that do this are intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their own importance.
- A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.

#### Principal 5 - talk in terms of the other person's interest.

- The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.
- If you really want somebody to be fixated on you, find their interests (what excites them) and learn about it and talk to them about that.
- Why talking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties? Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee communications, has always followed this principle. When asked what reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different reward from each person but that in general the reward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.

#### Principal 6 - Make the other person feel important-and do it sincirely
- here is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” 
- probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” 
- You want the approval of those with whom you comein contact. You want recognition of your true worth. Youwant a feeling that you are important in your little world.You don’t want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, butyou do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friendsand associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, “heartyin their approbation and lavish in their praise.” All of uswant that.
- The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.
- “Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.” 

### How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

#### Principal 1 - The Only Way to Win an Argument is Avoiding It

- "Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going tomake him like you? Why not let him save his face? Hedidn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why arguewith him? Always avoid the acute angle."
- I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it . 
	- Even if you win by proving that your opponent is objectvily wrong you still lost. Why? You hurt your opponent's pride and made he feel inferior which will make him resent you for that.
	- A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.
	- If you win an argument be ready to lose your opponent's good will.
	- People will fight to death to defend their opinion on an argument because the want to feel important and they not only want to protect their pride/ego they want to expand their pride/ego.
	- A misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.
	- “No man who is resolved to make the most of himself,” said Lincoln, "can spare time for personal contention. Neither can he afford to take the consequences, including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control. Yield larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.”
	- In an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions aremade on how to keep a disagreement from becoming anargument: Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “Whentwo partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” Ifthere is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankfulif it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreementis your opportunity to be corrected before you make a seriousmistake. 
	- Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best.
	- One of the best ways to figure a person out is to known what makes them angry.
	- Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends.
		- You can even postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later.
		- Valid Questions: Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?
#### A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES-AND HOW TO AVOID IT. Principle 2: Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, "You're wrong.” 
-  You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words - and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. 
		- That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings. Never begin by announcing "I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to saying:“I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.” That is a challenge. It arouses opposition makesthe listener want to battle with you before you evenstart..
- Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you taught them notAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot. 
- Over three hundred years ago Galileo said: You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.
-  As Lord Chesterfield said to his son: Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so. 
- Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneathor in the waters under the earth will ever object to yoursaying: "I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”
- Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star.
- The little word “my” is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is “my” dinner, “my” dog, and "my" house, or “my” father, “my” country, and “my” God... **my opinion**. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of “Epictetus,” of the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision.
- most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.
- We usually do not understand what other people say to us, we judge it (that's right, wrong, good, bad, horrible, ridiculous etc). Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other person.*
- How an engineer conviced her bosses to do what she wanted: I called another meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted it.
- Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, hecould be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel "Chappie”James, then the nation’s highest-ranking black officer.Dr. King replied, "I judge people by their own principles - not by my own.” In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance was astonished.“General,” he said, " do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies.". The General said: "He asked me what I think of him, not what he thinks of me".

#### Principle 3 - If You Are Wrong Admit It Quickly And Emphatically
-   The same policemen that said he was going to "put me in jail the next time" now was begging me to let my infrigment go because "it is not that big of a deal" just because I admitted that I was wrong to him when he caught me doing the same infrigment a second time. That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so when I began to condemn myself saying that I was shameless for doing it again, bla, bla, bla the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.
- While arguing with somebody, say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say - and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimized. 
- Any fool can try to defend his mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s mistakes.
- When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong- and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves - let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. "By fighting you neverget enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.” 

#### Principle 4 - Begin In A Friendly Way
-  "a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall." So with men, if you would win a man to you cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. 
- Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri ,I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said,"I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.” So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him. Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and thenthe sun came out from behind the clouds and smiledkindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his browand pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind thatgentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force. The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.
- The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world. 

#### Principle 5 (The Secret of Socrates) - Get The Person Saying Yes,Yes Imediately
- In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing - and keep on emphasizing - the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose. 
- Get the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset.Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “No.” When you have said “No,” all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once you say something, you feel you must stick to it, so lead the person to stick with agreeableness. 
- Getting people to say yes  makes them feel like you understand them and that you are thinking about them, that you are doing this for their sake. Anybody will do what is good for their sake! So they will gladly do what you say.
- Socratic method: when challenging people with a debate about something ask questions, get people to say yes to those questions (as many as you can), then make people admit that you are right by holding them accountable for the yesses that they gave. People would rather surrender the challenge and accepting that they you are right and they are wrong than going back on their own word and saying that the" yes" that they gave you a minute ago is actually a "no". Most people are not even close to being humble enough to do something like that, going back on your word is a bigger attack on your pride than challenging an idea and later being convinced that you are wrong. Therefore most people will take the lesser of 2 evils and will say that you are right.

#### Principal 6 - Let the other person do a great deal of thetalking.
- Must people trying to win others to their way of thinkingdo too much talking themselves. Let the other peopletalk themselves out. They know more about their businessand problems than you do. So ask them questions. Let them tell you a few things.
- “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.”. Make your friends feel like they are better than you if you want friends, and make them feel like you are better than them if you want enemies. When our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they - or at least some of them - will feel inferior and envious.

#### Principal 7 - Let the other person feel that the idea is his.
- Don’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try throw your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn’t it wiser to make suggestions - and let the other person think out the conclusion? 
- Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated: “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”
- Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use today:  " The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.”
#### Principal 8 - Find the point of view of the other person.
- Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But hey don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that. There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place. 
- Ask yourself: Why would he want to do this? What is the cause?
- Always think on what the person's will probably be if you ask a certain question. Think about it before you talk to that person.

#### Principal 9 - Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires. 
-  a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively: "I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”
	- This is obvious since if you were the other person obviously you would feel the way they do. That is because you would grow up in the same enviroment, have the same experiences, genetics and personallity as the other person. You deserve very little credit for being what you are- and remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit forbeing what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pitythem. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself: “There,but for the grace of God, go I.”
- Most people are starving for sympathy. If you give it to them they will die for you.
- Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book EducationalPsychology: “Sympathy the human species universallycraves. The child eagerly displays his injury; oreven inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundantsympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show theirbruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially detailsof surgical operations. ‘Self-pity’ for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice."
- Figure out what they feel and communicate to them that you acknowledge their feelings.

#### Principal 10 - Appeal to the nobler motives. Appeal To Ideals.
-  J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons fordoing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one. The person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.
- Nothing will work in all cases - and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment? 
- “Experience has taught me,” says Mr. Thomas, "that when no information can be secured about the person, the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges/fulfill their responsabilities, once convinced they are correct. To put it differently and perhaps more clearly, people are honest and want to discharge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair." 

#### Principal 11 - Dramatize Your Ideas.

- This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.

#### Principal 12 (when nothing works try this) - Thrown Down a Challenge

- Make people do what you want by stimulating in them the desire to excel by making them compete with themselves to achieve your desired results. The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to people of spirit.
- “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?
- “I have never found,” said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber Company,“that pay and pay alone would either bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game for getting the pay itself.” 
- Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavioural scientists, concurred. He studied in depth the work attitudes of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do you think he found to be the most motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs that was most stimulating? Money? Good working conditions? Fringe benefits? No - not any of those. The one major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.
- That is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-racesand hog-calling and pie-eating contests. The desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.


### Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment

#### Principal 1 - Begin With Praise And Honest Appreciation

- A very good tactic as well to make people more compliant with your will is to praise them before telling something that they dont like/ something that they dont want to do.
- Another very good idea is to tell people that what they did wrong was actually great and they should try to make it even better by trying to do it one more time. That is way better than saying: what you did is shit and you need to do it again.
- Go to the book and read the story of the Wark Company and Mr.Gaw very good story.
- Beginning with praise is like the dentist who beginshis work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling,but the Novocain is pain-killing. A leader will use . . .

#### Principal 2 (How to Critize And Not Be Hated For It) - Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.

- Simply changing one three-letter word: but; can often spell the difference between failure and success in changing people without giving offense or arousing resentment. Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word “but” and ending with a critical statement.
	- You should change "but" to "and": “We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and(instead of but) by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.” Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no follow-up of an inference of failure. We have called his attention to the behavior we wished to change indirectly and the chances are he will try to live up to our expectations.
- Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism.
#### Principal 3 (talk about your own mistakes first) - Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. 

-  It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable. 
- To correct his secretary writing mistake he said: " ‘Somehow this word doesn’t look right. It’s one of the words I always have had trouble with. That’s the reason I started this spelling book of mine. I opened the book to the appropriate page. Yes, here it is. I’m very conscious of my spelling now because people do judge us by our letters and misspellings make us look less professional. "I don't know whether she copied my system or not,but since that conversation, her frequency of spellingerrors has been significantly reduced.”
-  If you forget to praise/compliment before criticizing the next best thing is to praise/compliment after criticizing.
- When compliment/praising you should humble yourself/put your self down first and then feed into the person's pride saying things that will make them feel superior.
- Admitting one’s own mistakes - even when you hasn’t corrected them yet- can help convince somebody to change his behavior.  A father was able to stop his son from smoking just by telling his sun how he could not stop smoking and was addicted to it, even do he, the father, continued to smoke and did not change his behaviour.


#### Principal 4 (No One Likes To Take Orders) - Ask Questions Instead Of Giving Direct Orders

- “You might consider this,” or “Do you think that would work?; “What do you think of this?”, “Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.” Always give people the opportunity to do it themselves and learn from their mistakes.
- A technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A technique like that saves a person’s pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.
- Resentment from and order might last for a long time -even if the order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. 
- **People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.**

#### Principal 5 - Let The Other Person Save Face

- Find a way around people's pride. Something that doesn't attack their pride.
- We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride. Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!
-  Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. 
- "I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”

#### Principal 6 - Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”

-  Why don’t we use praise instead of condemnation? Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.  “Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise.” *
- Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F. Skinner’s teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animal sand with humans that when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.
- Never flatter always praise. Flattery is lazy, dishonest and artificial and praise is the opposite of that. We all crave appreciation and recognition,and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wantsinsincerity. Nobody wants flattery. 
- VERY TRUE -> Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.
- Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.

#### Principal 7 - Give the other person a fine reputation to liveup to.
- you can recognize skills/traits/accomplishments in people and use these things to create a reputation for that person. Make that reputation that you created for that person in the form of a compliment/praise. Naturally that person will do anything to uphold this new invented reputation that you created just for her to do what you want  because now it is a matter of defending their pride for them, if they like you/care about you they will even feel worried about not letting you down. Take something that you want them to do and do well at and create a reputation for them that will make the do what you want.
- A very good line to tell your future pawns to make them your pawns when the time comes might be: ‘{Name}, you do not know what treasures are within you.’ That is a very effective way to give somebody a reputation to live up to, even better if you make them care about/love you first.
- Another very good fabricated reputation to give people if you want them to do what you want: "I have respected the fact that you are always willing to listen and are **big enough to change your mind when the facts warrant a change.**” You just made it being reasonable a matter of pride for this person, all you need now is to actually be correct about whatever you are about to say... or convince the person that you are correct.
- “Give a dog a bad name andyou may as well hang him.” But give him a good name - and see what happens!
- Read the story of Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin,Ireland. -> VERY GOOD
- another very good fabricated reputation. Said to a very bad 9 year old boy that was causing a lot of trouble:  “Tommy, I understand you are a natural leader. I’m going to depend on you to help me make this class the best class in the fourth grade this year.” She reinforced this over the first few days by complimenting Tommy on everything he did and commenting on how this showed what a good student he was. With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old couldn’t let her down - and he didn’t.

#### Principle 8 - Make The Fault Seem Easy To Correct, Use Encouragment

- Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that heor she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift forit, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyedalmost every incentive to try to improve. But use theopposite technique - be liberal with your encouragement,make the thing seem easy to do, let the other personknow that you have faith in his ability to do it, thathe has an undeveloped flair for it - and he will practiceuntil the dawn comes in the window in order to excel. Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations,used this technique, He gave you confidence, inspiredyou with courage and faith.

#### Principle 9 - Making People Happy/Glad To Do What You Want

-  Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
- A man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations coming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, **he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about therefusal, He immediately changed the other person’sthoughts to some other speaker who could accept theinvitation.**
- But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and distributed15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his troops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticizedfor giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleonreplied, “**Men (and women too) are ruled by toys.**” This technique of giving titles and authority workedfor Napoleon and it will work for you. 
#### Effective Leader Guidelines

The effective leader should keep the following guidelinesin mind when it is necessary to change attitudes orbehavior: 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that youcannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourselfand concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 2. Know exactly what it is you want the other personto do. 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the otherperson really wants. 4. Consider the benefits that person will receivefrom doing what you suggest. 5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 
6. When you make your request, put it in a formthat will convey to the other person the idea that hepersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order likethis: " John, we have customers coming in tomorrowand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out,put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polishthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea byshowing John the benefits he will get from doing thetask: “John, we have a job that should be completedright away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced withit later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow toshow our facilities. I would like to show them thestockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweepit out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, andpolish the counter, it would make us look efficient andyou will have done your part to provide a good company image.” Will John be happy about doing what you suggest?Probably not very happy, but happier than if you had notpointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is interested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been pointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it later. It is naïve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these approaches, but the experience of most people shows thatyou are more likely to change attitudes this way than bynot using these principles - and if you increase your successesby even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10percent more effective as a leader than you were before- and that is your benefit.
