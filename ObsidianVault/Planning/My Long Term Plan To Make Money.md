There are a couple of things that I will need to manage simultaneously: 1. programming,  2. university, 3. workout, 4. content creation, 5. sleep


# 1 Programming

The plan is simple, you will finish both blackjacks (c# and rust) and make a [[BlackJack WebApp Game]]  that allows you to play blackjack with a GUI (the website/webpage). At this point you should already start trying to get good at networking on Linkedin and in real life and also get your name and your projects out there.

There are a couple of good youtubers for you to learn from when you are ready to start networking on linkedin:
- jayhoovy - for networking
- the pain of not being able to find a software job - Created by KC -> to give you hope that you can actually get a job if you just dedicate yourself to getting it
- Joshua Fluke - for doing well at interview and getting the most out of any companie your work for. Also for how to strategically make your CV to hide your weaknesses and display your strengths. Also to make you aware of how companies fool you and exploit you in the interview and after you get hired.

Then comes the hardest part: While you look for jobs you should make your resume look better. The only way you can do that as of right now is with more projects. Since you are going to look for C# junior positions, you should really try to create a website. But not any website, but a website that people will actually be interest in using. What I am trying to say is that if you can prove to the employers that you are able to create things that people actually want to use, then somebody will hire you for sure. The only way to make people want to use something is by catering to what they want/need/are interest in. So you should create a website for a group of people (people that belong to a niche group that do not get a lot of attention) and create a [[Website]] for them.
