Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

First, the 4 indicated DeepWork philosophies\

Primeira: Monastic DeepWork
Minimize shallow obligations as much as possible, therefore maximizing deep work. Dedicate all of your time and effort to deepworking. Example: hiring an assistant to throw irrelevant messages in the garbage, keep the meaninfull ones and only show the alarming ones immediately.

What is it good for? People that need to do one thing exceptionally well.

Segunda: Bimodal DeepWork
Switch between the monastic deepwork and openwork (not deepwork , work that is filled with distractions).
The minimun unit of time for Bimodal DeepWork is 1 full day, because they do not  believe that it is possible to achieve the highest level of concentration with anything less than a whole day. In other words, the bimodal philosophy expects you to do deepwork in periods of, at least, 1 full day. Example: engaging with the Monastic DeepWork in all weekdays and doing openwork on saturday and sunday.

What is it good for? People that acknowledge the value of the monastic philosophy but also want to rip the benefits that come with the shallow (not deep) part of the work. Like the benefits that come with being liked by  your boss or being funny, attentive and nice in the eyes of a hot woman that you work with.

Terceira: Rythimic DeepWork
	The act of transforming deepwork into a habit that you will do without thinking about it. Chain method: every day you dedicate to deepwork put a x on a paper, eventually you will create a chain. Your purpose will become not breaking the chain and deepwork will just become "what you do to not break the chain" (a habit). It also thinks that the minimum unit of time should be a long set of hours (3 to 4 hours) and is okay with the fact the highest level of concentration will not be achieved.

What is it good for? People like me. Why? Because it allows me to do deepwork consistently (everyday), even do I dont have any pressure on me to do it. (I could just sit in my room and masturbate all day long and I would be fine). It is also good for people that dont have the luxury to just disappear for a whole day, like most office workers for example.

Quarta: Journaling DeepWork
Trying to fit deepwork anywhere you can in your schedule. Lunchbreaks, doctor waiting rooms, etc. Because people that adopt this philosophy have to constantly switch from deep to shallow work, it requires an unbelivable amount of willpower and can seriously lead to burnout. The resistance generated from this constant switch is just to great for most people to handle. This method requires a lot of confidence that what you are doing is important and that you will succeed. You need to have conviction in yourself. This type of conviction is something that is usually achieved with previous success - it will be easier for a professional novelist to write novels in this appproach to deepwork than a beginner, because the professional novelist is already confident in his skills and recognized by his work.

What is it good for? Allows people who dont have time to at least engage in deepwork as best as they can.


4DX (4 Disciplines of Execution)

#1 Focus on what is Wildly Important
Your wildly important goals should be the only thing in your mind when you are about to do deepwork. Your ambition should be focused like concentrated sunlight coming from a magnifying glass.

#2 Act on Lead Measures
Lag and lead measures are measures to track your progress. Lag measures are the measurements of what you are trying to actually improve(programming), lead measurements refer to the behaviours that will get you there 
(what did you study?, for how long?, how much deepwork hours you've done today?, etc). Lag measures are useless because when you have them you already achieved your goal. Focusing, caring and tracking your lead measurements is what is going to make you achieve your goals.

#3 Keep A Compelling Scoreboard
"People play differently when there is a score".
A scoreboard is the perfect way for you to track, care and focus on your lead measures - take a piece of paper and make the rows the days of the week and the columns the weeks themselves. Then you will track how much
deepworking hours you've had in a day and circle the days where you had an achievement that came out of your efforts. 
This is a terrific source of disciple and motivation (not only to do the work but to work deeply), but it will also keep you grounded because of the fact that you will be aware that you are moving foward by circling the days where you had achievements.

#4 Create a Cadence of Accountability
The final step that will allow you to focus on lead measures.
You need to make a review that will comfront your scoreboard: reflect on the accomplishments, mistakes and things that you did right and also what are the actions nescessary to improved the scoreboard.
In my deepwork scoreboard the review should be done weekly, every sunday.

Shutdown
When my life inevatitably becomes busy, there should be a point in time in my day where I should "shutdown" and stop worrying about anything and everything only focusing on deepwork. No emails, whatsapp, social media, forget about your job responsabilities, etc. It is a good idea to create a ritual for the "shutdown" that has to accomplish to things: for every incomplete task, goal and project you (1) have a plan for it's completion and (2) it is stored in a place that you will revisit when the time is right.

ART (Attention Restoration Theory): In order for you to focus you need attention. Attention is a finite resource that depletes every time you concentrate on something. Therefore you need to take breaks where you stop paying attention to regain this nescessary resource, so you can focus again. Talking to friends, working out, going for a run are just some ways of restoring your attention. The problem is that your brain needs to  have the confidence that you will not need to use your attention for a long time for it to allow itself to truly recover, therefore the "shutdown" is important once again to give my brain the confidence that he can indeed "turn off" for the rest of the day.

Conciously thinking about stuff comes with a very high price: it absolutely depletes your brain's energy. Therefore you should only conciously think about things that are as valuable as the price you are paying.
	In decisions that require strict rules you will need your conscious mind to get a better result,
	for decisions that take in a lot of information and/or are subjective, abstract, unclear, etc your unconcious mind will make better decisions.


Embrace Boredom
Once your brain is used to on demand distracion, its hard to shake the addiction off when you want to focus. People that multitask are incapable of filtering out irrelevancy, managing a working memory and their brains activate way more parts of the brain then necessary for the task at hand (I know from experience that this is true) which just makes you waste a shit ton of mental energy. Once you're wired for distraction you start to crave distraction. For you to able to do deepwork you need to be good at rejecting distracting stimuly, but you don't need to elimate distracting behaviours (they will aways be there). All you need to do is stop distracting behaviours from hijacking your attention.

Study Like Roosevelt
Set a small amount of (1h) time with a timer to get something done.  During that period give everything you have to finish the task and really try to get it done in one hour. This is supposed to be intense and tiring. The point is to train your "focus brain muscle" to become stronger. After this intense period of time you should rest to make your stress levels go down in order to avoid burn out.

Productive Meditation
Take a time that  you are busy physically but not mentally and tackle a problem, task, etc mentally. Just like regular meditation, when your mind wonders away you should bring it back to the task you set out to think about. You should try productive meditation for at least 2 or 3 days a week. It will take multiple sessions before you can actually focus on the problem,but the rewards are incredible.
Be aware of your mind looping over and over to avoid actually thinking about the task and save energy, you should force yourseld to actually move forward in your task and not just loop over what you already know.
The whole point of productive meditation is to incentivise deep thinking, but deep thinking is pretty hard so this is how to do it: 1.Identify the variables that will play a part in getting the task done, 2. Identify what are the next steps to solving this problem with Next Step Questions and answer this questions, 3. After answering all of the Next Step Questions review all the answers that you had to these questions, 4. If you really want to think deeply repeat the process with the same task in mind until you are satisfied with the asnwers.

Attention control = the ability to focus on relevant information only, which allows you to have great memory. One side effect is the ability to concentrate better. How to train it? Memorize a deck of cards or something of the sort.
You should never do route memorization -  the act of just reading something over and over again until you memorize it. We humans are not good at that, what we are good at is memorizing scenes.

The Crafstman Approach to Tool Selection
Identify the core factors that will make you more sucessfull and happy in a tool, then identify the core factors that will make you more miserable and poor and compare both of them.Only use that tool if the positives outweight the negatives. Then 1. list all of your broad life goals and aspirations (dont be specific), 2. list the two or 3 most important activities that will make reach that goal (should be specific),3. compare these activities to each and every tool that you use and see if they have positive, neutral or negative overall impact in these activities, 4. only use the tools that you deemed to have positive overall impact (the positives are more positive than the negatives are negative)

The Law of The Vital Few: 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes. For every single one of your life goals you can probably identify dozens of activities that will make you reach your goal, but it is only the first 2 or 3 activities that will truly acquire the disered outcome.

Do Not Use Your Leisure Time For Nothing
	Every time you feel that feeling to just do what you have aways done. To just go and do the most dopaminergic irrelevant meaningless activity, stop. Think about if you really should do that, if that really is good for you, if that is something that you truly want to do. Based on the effort that you are putting in to make this summary my anwser is that you probably want to do something else with your life.

One of the things that I have to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of continuous hard activities; they dont tire like an arm or a leg. Except for sleep, the mind just earns to do something different and not something easy.

Shallow Work can Destroy Your Life. So Schedule Your Day.
British middle aged people that think they watch TV for 15 hours a day watch it for more than 28 hours. Americans that think they work 64 hours a week  really work for only 44 hours.
How to schedule: 1.grab a piece of paper and divide the time that you will be awake (nothing less than 30min), 2.Fill in the piece of paper completely from the begining to the end of your day (fill it with mundane and fun activities as well ), 3. As things dont go as planned, rewrite the rest of your day on the piece of paper; 4. If you stumble in something valuable during the day feel free to rewrite the schedule as well.
The schedule should aways be rewritten and updated with the question: What is the most logical thing that I can do with the rest of my day.
The schedule will make your days deterministic and give them structure as well, which will improve how you use your time exponentially.
Deep tasks, that require your expertise,provide a double benefit: they return more value per time spent, and they stretch your capabilities to their limit, leading to improvement. So leverage your schedule towards these tasks and against shallow tasks as they have a better return for time spent.

Develop the habit of allowing small bad things to happen. Otherwise you will never be ready for the life changing big things.

My DeepWork Ritual
First a ritual is important because it creates a repeatable easy to identify system that reduces the friction of entering in a deepwork state and it makes you reach that hyper focused state faster too. It will take experimentation to get it right.

Things to consider:
1. Location: where it will be, how can I minimize distractions, etc.
2. Time: How much time will I have to study in said location on average.
3. Finally what will your ritual/rituals be to maximize focus/time ratio? What will be the things, actions, thoughts that will trigger your deepwork?


Some Rituals of Other People:
1. Grand Gesture: the act of macking big actions that cost a lot (money, time, comfort, etc) to give importance to your work, therefore making you more motivated to work and to work deeply because, in your perception, the importance and value  of what you are doing has raised. Example: paying for a super expensive hotel room just to stay inside all day and only work.

My Rituals:
1. To start Rooseveltian deepwork: close the windows and lock the door of my room.
2. Everytime I cant finish a task today I will say to myself what is my plan for that task in the future.
