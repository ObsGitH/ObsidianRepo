display attribute values:

- Inline-block: separates the inline elements into blocks. Example: separates the different `<li>` of a `<ul>` into blocks making the different `<li>` have space between them . (but first the `<li>` elements need to have display attribute set to `inline`)
- Inline: turns the element into a inline element. Making them appear on the same line instead of different lines in the html page.
