The main point of circle of fifths is to organize the keys based on how many sharps/flats they have in the key signature.

Circle of fifths = F C G D A E B

That's the order of fifths, and it always stays the same. The next fifth after B is F#, and after that the order is the same, but there is a sharp in front of all of the notes (so F# C# G# D#, etc.). When you go in the flat direction, the next key from F is Bb, and after that the order is the same but there is a flat in front of all of the notes (and obviously in the flat direction you read it backwards, so Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb). That's really it. Remember that C major and A minor are the keys that have no sharps or flats. After that you always count one fifth up to get the key that has one more sharp (or one less flat) in the key signature, and one fifth down to get the key that has one more flat (or one less sharp) in the key signature.

So, sharp direction: F C G D A E B

Flat direction: B E A D G C F

Therefore the F major scale has one flat and it is Bb. That's because F is the fifth before C in the circle of fifths and since C has no flats or sharps and we flatten the scale when we follow the flat direction, the flatted will be only one and it will be Bb (look at the Flat direction).

**Do not forget that the whole circle of fifths keeps going:

clockwise: F C G D A E B F# Db Ab Eb Bb back to F.
anti-clockwise: F Bb Eb Ab Db F# B E A D G C back to F.

F C G D A E B is also the order of sharps (F# is the first sharp that is added to the key signature, C# is the second, etc.), and B E A D G C F is the order of flats (Bb is the first flat that is added to the key signature, Eb is the second, etc.).

# Relative Major and Minor Keys

Every major key (key that comes from a major scale) has a relative minor key.
The minor key of a major key is always the 6th degree(the sixth note) of the major key major scale.
The major key of a minor key is always the 3rd degree (third note) of the minor key minor scale.

## Through The Circle of Fifths
The minor key of a major key, taking the minor key as the starting point, can also be found by going to the 3rd note of the circle of fifths. Either through the sharp direction or the flat direction. 
For the major key of a minor key, taking the minor key as a starting point, you will go
3 notes backwards in the sharp direction or 3 notes forward in the flat direction.

The minor of C major key is A minor: sharp direction: C G D A (one , two, three)
flat direction:  A D G C (one, two, three but now in the flat direction)

Try to do get the major key of A minor(C) now as an exercise, using A minor as the starting point of course.

# **Major and Minor Chords:**

- The major and minor chords for each key can be derived from the scale degrees.
- The big roman numerals represent major keys or augmented keys and the small one's minor or diminished keys
- The I, IV, and V chords in a major scale of a key are major, while the ii, iii, and vi chords are minor. In a minor scale of the same key, this pattern is reversed.
- (there is a special simple that i cant type in obsidian for diminished chords, for augmented chords it is V+ the plus sign. Look it up ). Also diminished roman numerals are always lowercase because  and the augmented roman numerals are always uppercase
- vii chord is diminished in the major scale of the key. That would be the ii chord of the minor scale of that key.

# **Modulation:**

- The proximity of keys on the Circle of Fifths indicates the ease of modulation between them.
- Moving to adjacent keys typically involves changing only one or two accidentals, making the modulation smoother.

## Exercise:

Play a I-vim-IV-V progression and use the last chord as a new start to the next key in the circle of fifths:

C - Am - F - G then

G - Em - C - D then

D - Bm - G - A then

A - F#m - D - E then




## Step-by-Step How to Implement Modulation
1. **Identify the Current Key:**
    
    - Determine the key of the section you are in. This is your starting point.
2. **Choose a Target Key:**
    
    - Decide on the key to which you want to modulate. You may choose a closely related key or one that provides the desired musical effect.
3. **Find the Relationship:**
    
    - Locate the current key and the target key on the circle of fifths. If the keys are adjacent on the circle, they are closely related. If they are opposite each other, they are distantly related.
4. **Identify Common Tones:**
    
    - Look for common tones between the current key and the target key. Common tones can help smooth the transition between keys.
5. **Select a Modulation Technique:**
    
    - There are various modulation techniques, and the choice depends on the musical style and the effect you want to achieve. Common modulation techniques include:
        - **Direct Modulation:** Move directly from the current key to the target key without any transitional chords.
        - **Common Chord Modulation:** Introduce a chord that exists in both the current and target keys. This shared chord helps bridge the transition.
        - **Pivot Chord Modulation:** Use a chord that functions in both the current and target keys, acting as a pivot between them.
6. **Plan the Modulation:**
    
    - Determine where in the music you want to execute the modulation. Common points include the end of a section (e.g., a verse transitioning to a chorus) or at a cadence.
7. **Execute the Modulation:**
    
    - Introduce the chords or progressions that facilitate the modulation. This may involve using chords that help establish the new key or employing modulation techniques.
8. **Reinforce the New Key:**
    
    - Once you've modulated successfully, reinforce the new key with subsequent chords and progressions. This helps solidify the sense of tonal center in the new key.





# Diatonic Chords

THIS SHIT IS FUCKING CRAZY.

Very hard to generalize so I will just show you how to do it:

1. Take a major key. Let's say C major key.
2. Now take 7 keys following the circle of fifths in the sharp direction with the major key that you picked in the second position: F C G D A E B
3. The way it works is the key that you picked will be in the second position always. So the first key will be the key before your picked key in the circle of fifths. The other five will be the next 5 after the one you picked.
4. C is the first chord in C major(obviously). D is the second. E is the 3rd. F is the 4th. G is the 5th A is the 6th and B is the 7th!!!! Do you see the pattern? It always goes like this:  F: IV, C: I, G: V, D: ii, A: vi, E: iii, B: vii(dimished) . HOW CRAZY IS THAT? C Major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor and B dimished! That is literally every single chord in the c major scale!


# **Key Relationships:**

- Keys that are directly opposite each other on the Circle of Fifths have no common tones in their key signatures and are furthest apart harmonically.
- Keys that are closer together share more common tones and have a stronger harmonic relationship.
