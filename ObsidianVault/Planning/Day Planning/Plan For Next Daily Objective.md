You need to learn how to use git and github with the VScode extension.

## Rust

Rust Blackjack:
1. Finish the implementation of the game. DONE
2. Debug the game until it  works. DONE
3. Debug the game again but now thinking about edge cases.
4. Adjust the print messages throughout the game so the players can have a good experience (make it pretty) - Did some improvements but still needs to be better
5. Try to learn about rust best practices to optimize your program as much as possible (make it fast)
6.  Refactor the code to make it as readable as possible (make it readable/ make the code pretty)
	1. This would be a good time for you to understand Clean Code, Code Smells  and other retarded "Best Practices" (remember the only best practice is code compression)
		1. Remember that the real structure of code is sequential, therefore the most efficient way to write code is sequentially. Write the code if the code starts to repeat turn it into a funtion, if you start to use the same variables together over and over than turn those variables into fields of a class and so on. 
			1. I call this Sequential/Natural Programming Compression, because  the natural way in which programs execute statements is sequentially and all your focus is on using these paradigms (OOP, Functional programming and so on) to help with things like shared state, grouping of related variables, repetitive code and so on.  
				- It is very different than programming based on the paradigms cited above, you are focusing on the natural way the computer (and you as human being) work and using what these paradigms have to offer as the necessity for their tools arise throughout the development of your program.


## CSharp

You need to learn how to use VisualStudio with Github and you need to create repositories for your C# projects.

Start BlackJack MVC webapp.

1. Re-learn how to create a mvc application. DONE
2. Try to really understand what is going on and play around with it so you feel comfortable. DONE
3. If you have time play with razor syntax and bootstrap as well in order to spend less mental effort on this retarded markup  languages so you can focus on real programming. In Progress : (Already learned the razor syntax. Now I am going to play with it while learning Bootstrap as well)
	1. You should Understand what the Html class does because I think it has a very symbiotic relationship with razor
4. If you still have time after that you should consider learning signal-r. Just learn what you need to use in your web app, usually these technologies are gigantic.
