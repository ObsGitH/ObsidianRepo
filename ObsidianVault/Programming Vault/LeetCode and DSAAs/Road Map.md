	Common Mistakes:
1. Choosing a language that is too verbose (makes you loose time) python is really good for leet code by the way
2. Solving exercises in random order
3. Wasting your time banging your head against a wall trying to solve a problem you are not ready to solve
4. Not Reviewing your previous problems. Reviewing here is especifically: remembering what/how/why algorythms and structures used to solve the problem, remembering the trick/tricks of the problem. Needless to say you should write this shit down.
5. Not memorizing what you've already learned by repeating the salve problems/ kinds of problems over and over again. You need to memorize algorithms/structures/tricks just as much as you need to understand and practice them.

Dont forget that a lot of leet code problems are supposed to be solved sequentially.

DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN 45-60 minutes on a problem. If you are having that much trouble it means that you have something to learn before tackling said problem. (A good thing to do is looking the answer and see if you can find any "tricks" that were stopping your progress. A lot of medium and hard leet code problems have some sort of trick that you need to figure out to solve the problem)
	Hard problems are just like medium problems, but there is usually a more complex trick behind them.

In leet code problems you need to SEE what data structure is needed for the problem and apply it. This is important because you can save a lot of time if you truly understand what each of these data structures do which will allow you to correctly and consistently know what data structures you need to use for the problem.
	- In short: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY HOW THE DATA STRUCTURE WORK BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE's OF PROBLEMS IT CAN SOLVE. WHICH YOU WILL PROBABLY ONLY LEARN WITH PRACTICE LEET CODE PROBLEMS

# NEET CODE RULE OF THUMB FOR WHEN YOU ARE READY

	"You will probably be ready for leet code interviews when you can solve random medium level questions in 25-30min"

That is when I should start applying for interviews that expect leet code or data algorithms knowledge.
