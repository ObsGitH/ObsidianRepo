## Theoretical CSS

- What is a selector?
- What is a rule?
- What is a declaration?
	- Inside a declaration we have properties and values. What is a property and what is a value?
- What is a CSS rules? 
- What are CSS functions?
- What are CSS shorthands?
- What does DOM stands for?
- Explain the DOM in simple general terms.
- Explain how a Web page is loaded. Tip: it involves HTML, DOM,  CSS, different buckets for different CSS rules, how HTML becomes DOM, how the css that applies to each node in the DOM tree is selected, etc. [answer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works)
- Explain Web Mechanncs. [[How Does The Internet and Web Work]]

- When a browser finds selectors or properties that it does not understand they are simply ignored by the browser when loading the webpage.
- CSS is divided into modules that contain properties that relate to each other in a certain way. You can check out the modules in MDN.
- You can check if a browser supports a certain selector, sub element, subclass or property in MDN.
- You can write CSS inside the html file, in a separate file or with a `style` html attribute (the so called inline style) and you can also import CSS from another place.
- All HTML elements have default behavior that can be altered with CSS selectors
- What are classes, id's, pseudo classes, pseudo elements and how to use them in CSS?
- Cascade, Specificity and Inheritance.
	- When 2 selector's  that target the same element with the same level of **specificity** declare different values for the same property. CASCADE says that the declaration that was created last will override and have priority over the first declaration.

- Box Model: CSS elements all have a box around it. 
	- `block` - this box model always appear in a new line, always respects the `width` and `height` property values; changing `padding`, `margin` and `border` will always make other elements be pushed away from the box and If [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container.
	- `inline` - does not appear in a new line, `width` and `height` do not apply, `Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders` will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box and `Left and right padding, margins, and borders` will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
	- `inline-block` - mix of both: respects `width` and `height` (`block` box model) and `margin`, `border` and `padding` behave like the block element box model, but does not break onto a new line like the `inline` box model .
	- Inner and Outer Display: The outer display of a element is it's default box model and cannot be changed. But you can change the inner display with the `display` property.
	- - Parts of a box: in the Box Model  
		- 1.content : the rectangle/box where your content is displayed (`width` and `height` CSS properties define the size of this rectangle), 
		2. Padding: the space between content and border, 
		3. Border: line that separates padding and margin and 
		4. Margin: space between this element's box and another element's box.
			- If 2 element's margins there will be Margin Collapse:
				- If two margins that touch each other have both positive values the margin will collapse as the margin with the bigger value. If both of them are negative they will collapse into the one with the smallest value and if one is positive and the other negative the resulting margin is the positive value - the negative one.
		```CSS
		.box {
		  width: 350px;
		  height: 150px;
		  margin: 10px;
		  padding: 25px;
		  border: 5px solid black;
		}
		```
		The _actual_ space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).


- Writing Mode
	- When talking about righting modes there are 2 dimensions: `block` and `inline` dimension. They exist to keep things consistent when changing writing modes.
			- For example: 2 `div`'s one `horizontal-tb`, the other `vertical-rl` writing modes. If I style: `div{ width: 500;}` in the horizontal `div` I will be altering the size of the `inline` dimension and in the vertical `div` the `block` dimension. If I want things to be consistent no matter the writing mode, I need to work with the `block-size` and `inline-size` properties instead of  `width` and `height`.
	- `block` dimension always corresponds to the direction in which blocks are displayed on the page: 1top-to-bottom, 2right-to-left or 3left-to-right. The dimension starts at the 1top/2right/3left (`block-start`) and ends at the 1bottom/2left/3right(`block-end`).
	- `inline` dimension always follows the direction in which sentences grow/flows. `inline-start` is where the sentences starts and `inline-end` is where the sentences end.


- [Block Formatting Context (BFC)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context)
	- When you create a BFC the content of  an element box acquire a self-contained layout. Nothing outside the element's box can poke  at the surrounding layout and vice-versa.

- Overflow
	- Overflow happens when there is too much content to fit in a box that a fixed sized. Examples of this are the viewport, a block level element and any other element that has a box model that respects `width` and `height`  and have absolute units for these 2 properties.
	- CSS always tries to avoid data loss by default. Therefore the content that cannot fit inside a box will  break out of the box and leak to the rest of the webpage.


- CSS Values
	- `<integer>` - only whole numbers.
	- `<number>` -  whole numbers and floating point numbers.
	- `<dimension>` - `<number>`  with units attached to it.
		- `<length>` - represents a distance value.
		- Relative Length Units
			- `em` Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like `font-size`, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like `width`.
				- The default element's font size is inherited from their parent. Therefore all elements have the same font-size as the `html` element in the beginning.
			- `ex`x-height of the element's font.
			- `ch`The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font.|
			- `rem`Font size of the root  element (`html` selector or `:root` pseudo-class selector that will usually target the `html` element anyways).
				- **The font size of the `html` element is always 16px by default in all browsers. Changing the font size of the `html` element will change the values of all properties that have `em` and `rem` values.**
			- `lh` relative to the line height of the element.
			- `rlh` relative to the line height of the root element. When used on the `font-size` or `line-height` properties of the root element, it refers to the properties' initial value.
			- `vw`1% of the viewport's width.
			- `vh`1% of the viewport's height.
			- `vmin`1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
			- `vmax`1% of the viewport's larger dimension.
			- `vb`1% of the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element's [block axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values#block_vs._inline).
			- `vi`1% of the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element's [inline axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values#block_vs._inline).
			- `svw, svh`1% of the [small viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport)'s width and height, respectively.
			- `lvw, lvh`1% of the [large viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport)'s width and height, respectively.
			- `dvw, dvh`1% of the [dynamic viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport)'s width and height, respectively.
		- Absolute Length Units - `cm`, `mm`, `Q`, `in`, `pc`, `pt`, `px`
			- `Q` -> Quarter of a `mm (Milimeter)
			- `in` -> Inches, 2.54`cm` or 96`px`
			- `pc` -> Pica, one sixth of an `in`
			- `pt` ->  Points, one twelvth  of a `pc`(Pica)
	- `<percentage>` - relative value, represents a fraction of another value. If the `width` property has a percentage value that percentage is a fraction of the `width` property value of it's parent element. this applies to properties that are not `width`.
	- `<colors>`
		- `<named-colors>`
		- `rgb()` function. Values 0-256 repeated 3 times to control degrees of red, green and blue colors.
			- fourth parameter  represents the alpha channel of the color, which controls opacity.  `0`  will make the color fully transparent, `1` will make it fully opaque.
		- Hexadecimal: `#4d543A`. 3 hexadecimal pairs to control degrees of red, green and blue since 16 * 16 == 256.
		- Others that I will not bother explaining: There are several color functions that include a [`<hue>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) component, including `hsl()`,`hwb()`, and [`lch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch). Other color functions, like [`lab()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lab), define colors based on what humans can see.
	- `<image>` - value used when the property accepts an image as a value like `background` for example.
	- `<positi0n>` - represents a set of 2D coordinates for an item
		- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `rigth`, `center`, `etc` -these are identifiers.
	- Identifiers - strings that serve as aliases to values that CSS can understand. All `<named-colors>` values are identifiers.
	- Strings - values that are usually used with generated content which usually happens when you are selecting pseudo-classes/elements. This values, literally, strings: "this is a string value". `content` property takes a string value for example.


- Item Sizing
	- Intrinsic size - the predefined values for element's size related properties(width, height, etc).
	- By default, a lot of elements change their size as content is added to them.
	- Because of overflow and different viewport size's it is better to determine the size of things with relative values.
		- Relative values on `padding` and `margin` properties use the parent's `inline-size` property value as a reference.
	- `1vw` / `1vh` are equal to 1% of the viewport's width/height and can be very helpful to determine the size of boxes and text. `font-size: vw` will ensure that the font-size will remain consistent in different viewports for example. 


- MultiMedia and Form Elements
	- These items behave kinda weird so it's important to learn about them separately.
		- These items are **Replaced Elements** meaning there internal layout cannot be altered by CSS. (you cannot change their inner display.)
		- In a flex or grid layout, elements are stretched by default to fill the entire area. Images will not stretch, and instead will be aligned to the start of the grid area or flex container.
	- There is a whole fucking [mdn module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) for styling forms.
	- Since form elements use different box sizing rules for different widgets, it is a good idea to set margins and padding to `0` on all elements, then add these back in when styling particular controls
	```css
	button,
	input,
	select,
	textarea {
	  box-sizing: border-box;
	  padding: 0;
	  margin: 0;
	}
	```
	- Set `overflow` property to `auto` in `textarea` elements to add the scroll bar if the element gets too big.


- Debugging CSS
	- Press `CTRL + U` to the page's source code.
	- Press `F12` to access the browser's debugger.
		- `RightClick then Inspect` or click on element in the HTML Tree  to Inspect that element.
		- The Inspection of a said element will make the Debugger [Views](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/ui_tour/index.html#rules-view) focus on it. (What each view does can also be know through this link)
		- You are able to expand shorthand properties through the debugger.
		- You can toggle property values in the Rules view on and off and see how that affects your webpage. You can also edit those values.
		- You can add properties to elements with  the + button to add an additional rule with the same selector, and add your new rules there.
		- It is SO MUCH EASIER to figure out problems with the box model's size with the debugger than through any other means.
		- Sometimes the element just doesn't seem to take the CSS... a more specific selector is probably overriding your changes. The debugger allows you to see which properties from which selectors are being applied to the element. Properties that have been overriden will be crossed by a straight line.
		- Properties that are not supported by the browser will have a yellow danger sign next to them.
		- The debugger has a special inspection of grid layouts.
		- You  can press `Ctrl + Shift + M` on firefox debugger to access the Responsive Design Mode
			- You can easily make the viewport smaller and larger to see where the content would be improved by adding a media query and tweaking the design.
	- The DOM(Document Object Model) on the browser's debugger might be different than your source code due to corrections of errors in the source code. The DOM [HTML Tree](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/examine_and_edit_html/index.html#html-tree) shows what is being rendered in the browser, the source code shows what code is stored in the server.
	- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) will check for any syntax errors in your code.
	- **Steps to Reduce Test Case**:
		-  If your markup is dynamically generated — for example via a CMS — make a static version of the output that shows the problem. Do a View Source on the page and copy the HTML into CodePen, then grab any relevant CSS and JavaScript and include it in there too. Then check whether the issue is still evident.
		-  If removing the JavaScript does not make the issue go away, don't include the JavaScript. If removing the JavaScript _does_ make the issue go away, then remove as much JavaScript as you can, leaving in whatever causes the issue.
		- Remove any HTML that does not contribute to the issue. Remove components or even main elements of the layout. Again, try to get down to the smallest amount of code that still shows the issue.
		-  Remove any CSS that doesn't impact the issue.
		- Ask somebody that knows more than you.


- Organizing CSS
	- Follow the teams CSS guidelines like the [MDN CSS Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/CSS) and if there is none create your own or adopt a well know guideline like
	- add fallback properties for old browsers that do not support the new properties.
	- Separated rules into sections separated by CSS comments:
		- General Styles (Rules that define a general style for a certain element), 
		- Utilities(Theses styles will change a lot of elements. They select a certain class of elements for example. ),
		- SiteWide (Selectors that will style the whole site like header and nav styling)
		- Finally  include CSS sections for specific things, broken down by the context, page, or even component in which they are used.
	- Avoid overly-specific selectors
	- Break large stylesheets into smaller ones
	- Define Custom Properties
		- CSS now has native [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).  if you realize you have used the wrong shade of blue, you only need change it in one place.
```css
@property --my-color {
	syntax: "<color>";
	inherits: false;
	initial-value: #3f4ddd;
}

```
``
	- MDN CSS GUIDELINES
		- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code. (It is a extension in VS code)
		- Plan your styles carefully. What general styles are going to be needed, what different layouts do you need to create, what specific overrides need to be created, and are they reusable? Above all, you need to try to **avoid too much overriding**. If you keep finding yourself writing styles and then cancelling them again a few rules down, you probably need to rethink your strategy.
		- Use relative units
		- Don't use preprocessor syntax
		- don't write example codes on MDN Web Docs using a specific CSS methodology such as [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) or [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/).
		- In the modern world, CSS resets can be an overkill, resulting in a lot of extra time spent reimplementing things that weren't completely broken in the first place
		- `!important` is the last resort that is generally used only when you need to override something and there is no other way to do it. Using `!important` is bad practice.
		- Avoid redundant CSS comments
		- Where quotes can or should be included, use them, and use double quotes.
		- shorthands are usually better than longhands
			- It is often harder to understand what the shorthand is doing.
			- With shorthands default values are set for parts of the syntax that you don't explicitly set, which can produce unexpected resets of values you've set earlier in the cascade or other undesired effects.
			- Some shorthands only work as expected if you include the values in a certain order. Like the `animation` property.
		- In a stylesheet that contains [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) styles to target different viewport sizes, first include the narrow screen/mobile styling before any other media queries are encountered. Add styling for wider viewport sizes via successive media queries.
		- Don't use ID selectors because they are:
			- less flexible; you can't add more if you discover you need more than one.
			- harder to override because they have higher specificity than classes.
		- When turning off properties that can take `0` or `none` as values, use `0` rather than `none`. Usually done to `border` property.
## Practical CSS
- `/*comments*/` - to write comments.
- Selectors and Combinators
	- Type Selector
		- `span` - selects a html element.
	- Universal Selector
		-  `*` selects every element.
	- Id, Class, Pseudo class/element selectors:
		- `#id` selects elements that have id attribute equal to id.
		- `.class` selects elements that have the class attribute equal to class.
			- `p.class` - select's all `p` elements that have a class attribute with the value of class.
			- `p.class.class2` - selects p elements that have both class and class2 as values for it's class attribute.
		- `element:pseudo-class` selects a pseudo class of a specific element.
		- `element::pseudo-element` selects a pseudo element of a specific element.
	- Attribute selector
		- `a[title]` - selects all `a` that have the `title` attribute.
		- `a[href="https://example.com"]` - selects all `a` that have the `href` attribute with that especific value.
		- `p[class~="special"]` - selects all p elements that have a `class` attribute with the value not equal to `special`.
		- `div[lang|="zh"]` - selects a `div` that has a `lang` attribute value that is `zh` or starts with `zh-` followed by something.
		- `[attr^=value]` - Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute, whose value begins with _value_.
		- `[attr$=value]` - Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value ends with _value_.
		- `[attr*=value]` - Matches elements with an _`attr`_ attribute whose value contains _`value`_ anywhere within the string.
		- `li[class^="a" i]` - the `i` means that it's looking for a **case insesitive** match, meaning a `class` attribute that begins it's value with the string a or A.
	- Combinators
		- `ul em` selects all `em` elements that are direct or indirect ancestors of a `ul` element. 
		- `h1 + p` selects the  first `p` element that comes directly after a `h1` .
		- `h1 ~ p` selects all `p` elements that come after a `h1` element
		- `h1, h2` - will apply the selector body to both `h1` and `h2` element's
		- `ul > em` selects only the `em` elements that are direct children of `ul` elements.
	- Complex Selectors
		- Nesting Selector(&) - example:
			```CSS
			p + span {
			  & ~ img {
			  }
			}
			```
			 In the nested selector, & represents the `p + span` nesting selector.
		- Without & - example
			```CSS
			p + span {
			  img {
			  }
			}
			```
			The nested selector would be interpret as `p + span img` meaning all `img` elements that are children of `p + span`.
		
			
- Specificity - A very complex topic that is not really that necessary for me now since I am a noob.
	- 
- Functions
	- [Math Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions#math_functions)
		- `calc()`: allows you to do basic math operations in order to determine a more complex value for properties that accept `length`, `number` or `integer` type values.
		- not supported by older browsers
	
	- The `transform` property has a bunch of functions to define  it's value.
		- [Transform Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions#transform_functions)
			- `matrix()`
			- `translate()`
			- `scale()`
			- `rotate()`
			- `skew()`
	- `url()` - gets the resource that is stored in that URL.
	- `<gradient>` values:
		- `linear-gradient(<color>1, <color>2)` - just a standard gradient, starts with a color at the top and transitions to the other
		- `radial-gradient(<color>1, <color>2)` - the transition starts from the center ends at the borders.
		- `conic-gradient(<color>1, <color>2)` - transitions happens following the radius of a circle..
		- Repeating gradients -> `repeating-` before one of the previous 3 like: `repeating-linear-gradient(<color>1, <color>2, gradient-limit(so the gradient can repeat itself))` for example.
	- `repeat(numberOfTimes, value)` - when giving values to a property repeat the same `value` for a `numberOfTimes`.
	- `minmax(minValue, maxValue)` - makes one property value range between `minValue` and `maxValue`
- Rules
	- `@import` - imports a CSS style sheet - [@import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import)
	- `@media` - creates [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries)
	- **`@namespace`** is an [at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule) that defines XML [namespaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Namespace) to be used in a [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) [style sheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet).
		- `ns|h1` - matches `<h1>` elements in namespace _ns_
		- `*|h1` - matches all `<h1>` elements
		- `|h1` - matches all `<h1>` elements without any declared namespace
		- `ns|*` - matches all elements in namespace _ns_
		- `*|*` - matches all elements
		- `|*` - matches all elements without any declared namespace
		- rule use example: `@namespace svg url('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg');`
	-  
- Box Model and Layout Related Properties
	- `display` - sets the inner display/layout of a element.
		- by setting `display: flex;`. The `<p>`will still use **the outer display type `block` but this changes the inner display type to `flex`. Any direct children of this box will become flex items and behave according to the [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) specification.**
		- `display: inline-flex` creates an inner display of an inline box containing some flex items.
		- `display: inline-block` - Use it if you do not want an element to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect `width` and `height` and avoid the overlapping that happens in `inline` elements. [Know More](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#using_display_inline-block)
	- `width`
		- `min-width` - the element's width cannot be less than this.
		- `max-width` - obvious.
	- `height`
		- `min-height`
		- `max-height`
	- `box-sizing`
		- `border-box` value: enables a alternative box model where the `width` property value is the total width of the box model. Now, the content's box == `width` value (text content area size) - 2 times `padding` value - 2 times border-width value.
	- `margin` - shorthand property that determines the margin of the element
	- `border` - shorthand property of other shorthand properties: `border-width border-style border-color`. 
		- `border-radius` - creates rounded corners in your border. `border-radius: horizontal-radius vertical-radius;`
	- `padding` - shorthand property
	- `opacity` - controls the opacity of the element's box model.
- Background Related Properties
	- `background` = `background-image1 background-position / background-size background-repeat,
		`background-image2, and so on...`. Shorthand Property.
		- `background-color`
		- `background-image` - displays an image in the background of an element.
			- accepts `<gradient>` values, therefore your `background-image` can be a gradient.
			- allows multiple values which will be equivalent to multiple images, as long as they are separated by a comma.
				- all other properties that relate to this one will target the images in the order that you set them up here. The values in the other properties will be separated by commas too.
		- `background-repeat` - controls if and how  a background image repeats itself in the background
			- Values: `no-repeat`, `repeat`, `repeat-x` (only in the x axis), `repeat-y`
		- `background-size` - adjust the size of the `background image`
			- Values: `<length>`, `<percentage>` and:
				- `cover` - increases/decrease size of `background-image` to fill the background completely while respecting the image's ratio, which will probably require the image to be [cropped](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+crop+image+means&oq=what+does+crop+image+means&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQABgTGIAEMgwIAhAAGA8YExgWGB4yCggDEAAYExgWGB7SAQg0MDU5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-**8**)
				- `contain` - will make the image occupy as much background space as possible while respecting it's ratio and not cropping it. 
					- chances are the background  will not be completely filled by the `background-image`.
		- `background-position` - adjust the position of the `background-image`
			- Values: coordinates -> `(x, y)`, a mix of `<length>`, `<percentage>` and `top`,`center`, `left`, etc values.
				- When working with 2 values (`background-position: top center;`) the first one will determine the horizontal offset and the second the vertical offset.
				- When working with 4 values each value determines the distance of an edge of the background.
		- `background-scroll` - defines the background's reaction to a mouse scroll
			- There is no way to explain it better than [this](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/styling-boxes/backgrounds/background-attachment.html).
- Writing Mode Related Properties
	- `writing-mode` - defines the direction in which block level elements are displayed.
	- `block-size` - defines size of `block` dimension.
		- `min-block-size` - block dimension size cannot be less than this.
		- `max-block-size` - obvious.
	- `inline-size` - defines size of `inline` dimension.
		- `min-inline-size`
		- `max-inline-size`
	- `margin-block`/`margin-inline`, `padding-block`/`padding-inline`, `border-block`/`border-inline` are all shorthand properties that define the margin, padding and border of `block` and `inline` dimensions respectively.
	 !IMPORTANT:
	- The `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` values are mapped to `block-start`, `inline-end`, `block-end`, and `inline-start`. This is important since you cannot explain the behavior of these values without knowing this.
- Overflow Related Properties
	- `overflow` - defines if the overflowing content will  be hidden, leak to the rest of the webpage or accessible through scrolling. Shorthand property for (respectively): 
			- `overflow-x` - defines the behavior for x-axis overflow only.
			- `overflow-y` - defines the behavior for y-axis overflow only.
		- If you want scrollbars to appear when there is more content than can fit in the box, use `overflow: auto`. This will create a BFC.
		- The property value `scroll` also creates a BFC.
		- Changing overflow values to `hide` content or to add scrollbars is reserved for a few select use cases (for example, where you intend to have a scrolling box).
- Pseudo Classes/Elements Related Properties
	- `content` - replaces elements content with a generated value. Usually use when targeting pseudo-elements `::before` or `::after`. Actually very cool property.
- Size Related Properties
	- `width`
	- `height`
	- `font-size`
	- `border-width`
	- `inline-size`
	- `block-size`
- Images, Media, Form Related Properties
	- `object-fit` - adjust the size of the object to fit it's parents box.
			- Values: `<length>`, `<percentage>` and:
				- `cover` - increases/decrease size of the object to fill the box completely while respecting the object's ratio, which will probably require the image to be [cropped](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+crop+image+means&oq=what+does+crop+image+means&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQABgTGIAEMgwIAhAAGA8YExgWGB4yCggDEAAYExgWGB7SAQg0MDU5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-**8**)
				- `contain` - will make the object occupy as much background space as possible while respecting it's ratio and not cropping it. 
					- chances are the box  will not be completely filled by the object.
- Table Styling Related Properties
	- `table-layout` - value `fixed`(a fixed size for the table column's, makes the table behavior predictable) or `auto`(column size grows according to the size of it's content)
	- `border-collapse` - determines if the borders will `collapse`(default) or be `separate`
	- `padding` - to make the table data breathe.
	- `border` - to clearly separate table parts from each other.
	- `font-family`
	- `text-align` - determines how the text aligns with it's box.
	- `background` - determine background for table foot, head, and/or body
	- `text-shadow` - makes the table's text cooler.
	- `letter-spacing` - makes text more beautiful/readable.
	- Caption Specific Properties
		- `caption-side` - determines position of the caption's box in relation to the table's box.


## Tips
- 
- Identify the critical default behaviors of an element in order to not change them in a way that makes the identification of the element in the webpage impossible to the user.  Like taking the default underlined bellow `a` element's from them for example. 
- **Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible: `<p style: bla,bla,bla></p>`.** It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand.
- You should use shorthands whenever you can.
-  To momentarily deactivate certain selectors and/or propertys you can just wrap them up in a CSS comment.
- Write fallback properties and property values that are supposed to ensure compatility for different browsers and old browsers before the main properties and property values inside the selector body.
- You can use the universal selector to make your complex selector's (one's that use a lot of combinators) more easy to understand.
- Old layouts required you to know how much content your webpage would have but modern layouts work without making assumptions on the amount of content of your webpage and therefore are able to manage overflow pretty gracefully. **Ideally, you should always refactor your layout to not rely on fixed size containers.**
- Test designs with large and small amounts of content. Increase and decrease font sizes by at least two increments. Ensure your CSS is robust.
- If you want to ensure that an element will inherit the value of it's parent property for it's own property give said property the value `inherit`. `font-family: inherit;`


# Cascade, Specificity and Inheritance

**(Cascade Layers)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers]** Is a very complex topic and you should not waste your time with it until you mastered everything

## Theory
There is a whole separate chapter for this topic because they are that fucking complex.
-  Cascade: When two rules from the same cascade layer apply and both have equal specificity, the one that is defined last in the stylesheet is the one that will be used. 
- Specificity: If multiple style blocks have different selectors that configure the same property with different values and target the same element, specificity decides the property value that gets applied to the element.
	- Pseudo-elements/Pseudo-class have the same specificity of elements/class selectors.
	- attribute selectors have same specificity as class selectors.
	- You determine specificity with the inlineStyle-identifier(id)-class-element rule. The rule is simple, inline styles(defined with the `style` HTML attribute) always prevail over id, id prevails over class and so on. All you need to do is count the amount of id's classes and elements are there in your selector. Example:
		the selector `li > a[href*="en-US"] > .inline-warning` has 
		0-0-2-2 specificity.
		
- Inheritance: some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't. You can change that by passing the `inherit` value to a property ensuring that the parent property value will be inherited.
- CSS Location: the precedence of a CSS declaration depends on what stylesheet and cascade layer it is specified in. It is possible for users to set custom stylesheets to override the developer's styles.
	- It is also possible to declare developer styles in cascade layers: you can make non-layered styles override styles declared in layers or you can make styles declared in later layers override styles from earlier declared layers. For example, as a developer **you may not be able to edit a third-party stylesheet, but you can import the external stylesheet into a cascade layer so that all of your styles easily override the imported styles without worrying about third-party selector specificity.**
	- Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, with later ones overriding earlier ones:
		1. Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g., the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).
		2. Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).
		3. Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).
		4. Important declarations in author style sheets.
		5. Important declarations in user style sheets.
		6. Important declarations in user agent(the browser) style sheets.

## In Practice

- Inheritance Related Element Properties
	- `inherit`: turns inheritance on or off in a child element.
	- `initial`: sets the property values of that element to it's default values, therefore getting rid of inherited property values.
	- `revert`: Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value acts like [`unset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unset) in many cases.
	- `revert-layer`: Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous [cascade layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer).
	- `unset`: resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like `inherit`, otherwise it acts like `initial`.
	- The **`all`** [shorthand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property resets all of an element's properties except [`unicode-bidi`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi), [`direction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/direction), and [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). It can set properties to their initial or inherited values, or to the values specified in another cascade layer or stylesheet origin.
- Specificity Related Properties/Flags/etc:
	- !important: This flag is used to make an individual property and value pair the most specific rule, thereby overriding the normal rules of the cascade, including normal inline styles.
		- **we strongly recommend that you never use `!important` unless you absolutely have to.** The `!important` flag changes the way the cascade normally works, so it can make debugging CSS problems really hard to work out, especially in a large stylesheet.
		- The only way to override an important declaration is 1. to include another important declaration with the _same specificity_ later in the source order, 2. or one with higher specificity, 3. or to include an important declaration in a prior cascade layer




# Styling Text

## Theoretical Text Styling
Text styling fundamentals - setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. How to apply custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

- Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached
- General CSS Text Property Categories
	- Text Font Styles - Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.
		- Web Fonts are the fonts that are supported by all browsers. They should always be in your styles as a fallback option.
		- Default Fonts: `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`(these 3 are more predictable), `cursive`, and `fantasy`. They represent a _worst case scenario_ where the browser will try its best to provide a font that looks appropriate.
			- These are very generic and the exact font face used from these generic names can vary between each browser and each operating system
		- Font Size
	- Text Layout Styles - Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text.


- Styling Lists
	- When styling lists, you need to adjust their styles so they keep the same vertical spacing as their surrounding elements (such as paragraphs and images; sometimes called vertical rhythm), and the lists in your web page should have the same horizontal spacing as each other.


- Styling Links - how to make use of pseudo-classes to style link states effectively and  how to style links for use in common interface features whose content varies, such as navigation menus and tabs.
	- Use underlining for links, but not for other things.
	- Make links react in some way when hovered/focused, and in a slightly different way when activated.
	- link styles build on one another. . If you put link states in the wrong order things won't work as you expect.
		- Order of States in CSS (topmost to bottom-most): `link visited focus hover active` .
		- States like hover can be used to style many different elements(`<p>, <li>), not just links.
	- Links commonly styled to look and behave like buttons. A website navigation menu can be marked up as a set of links, and this can be styled to look like a set of control buttons or tabs that provide the user with access to other parts of the site.
## Practical Text Styling

- `br` - HTML element, breaks line forcefully.

- General CSS Text Property Categories
	- Font Style Properties
		- Shorthands:

				- `font-size, font-family` are the only obligatory ones.
		- `color` - sets color of foreground content of an element, which is usually text
			- can also include underline and overline placed with `text-decoration` property.
		- `font-family`
			- Allows you to font-stack: pass multiple fonts as values separated by commas in order to provide fallback.
		- `font-size`
			- avoid setting a value for this property on container elements.
		- `font-style` - *rarely used*. Makes text italic. Values: `normal`, `italic`, `oblique`(simulates italic by slanting the normal font).
		- `font-weight` - determines how bold the text. Values: `100-900`, `ligher, bolder`(one step lighter or heavier than parent's boldness), `normal, bold` - normal and bold font weight.
		- `text-transform` - values: `none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, fullwidth
			- `full-width` -  Transforms all glyphs to be written inside a fixed-width square, similar to a monospace font.
		- `text-decoration` - `none`, `underline`, `overline`, `line-through`
			- you'll mainly use this to unset the default underline on links when styling them
			- accepts multiple values separated by a space

			- 1st - Horizontal Offset(obligatory)
			- 2nd - Vertical Offset (onbligatory)
			- 3rd - Blur Radius (Optional: 0 by default)

	- Text Layout Style Properties
		- `text-align` - justifies the text

				- it can look terrible
		- `line-height` -  sets the height of each line of text.

	- List Styling Related Properties
		- HTML List Elements Default Property Values:
			- `margin`
				- Default: `1em` for lists. Therefore , unless you altered the `margin` value in the  root element or any other parent element, the value is `16px`
				-  [`<dd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd) elements have [`margin-left`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left) of `40px` (`2.5em`).
				- It is a good idea for lists and list items to have the same `margin` value as paragraphs.
			- `padding-right`
				- Default: `2.5em`== `40px`
				- `<dl>` has no default for `padding`
			- `dir`
				- Default: `ltr`
			- `<li>` html element has no default for spacing
			- - HTML Attributes
				- `start="number"` HTML attribute allows you to start the list item count with the number the you pass to it.
				- The [`reversed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol#reversed) attribute will start the list counting down instead of up.
				- The [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#value) attribute allows you to set your list items to specific numerical values.
		- List-specific Styles
			- `list-style` - shorthand for (none of them are obligatory and can be applied in any order):
				- `list-style-type` - Sets the type of bullets to use for the list,
				- `list-style-position` - Sets whether the bullets, at the start of each item, appear inside or outside the lists.
				- `list-style-image` - Allows you to use a custom image for the bullet.
					- You are better off using the [`background`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) family of properties to create a custom bullet since this property is pretty limited... `background-image`, `background-position`, `background-size` and `background-repeat` to be more specific.
	- Link Styling Related Properties and Pseudo Classes
		- Pseudo Classes
			- `:link` - a link that has a destination.
			- `:visited` - already visited link
			- `:hover` - currently hovered with the mouse
			- `:focus` - currently focused with the TAB key or programmatically focused using [`HTMLElement.focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus)
			- `:active` - you are clicking on it
		- Default CSS - links are underlined, blue when unvisited, purple when visited, change mouse icon when you visited it, have a black outlined when focused and are red when active. You can change the default with:
			- [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) for the text color.
			- [`cursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) for the mouse pointer style — you shouldn't turn this off unless you've got a very good reason.
			- [`outline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) for the text outline. An outline is similar to a border. The only difference is that a border takes up space in the box and an outline doesn't; it just sits over the top of the background. The outline is a useful accessibility aid, so should not be removed without adding another method of indicating the focused link.
		- Add icons to links using the `background-family` just like you did with the list items.
		- To Make Links Behave Like Buttons (very common in `<nav>` menus)
			- Set the container of the links to be a `flexbox`. In the same container selector give `gap` property a relative value.
			- Now in the `<a>` element selector:
				- `flex: 1;` - so all the `<a>` have the same size as flex items.
				- `text-decoration: none;` - to remove it
				- `outline-color: transparent;` - to remove it
				- `text-align: center` - 
				- `line-height: 3` - to give the buttons some height (which also has the advantage of centering the text vertically.
					- A unitless line-height value == said value multiplied by the element's font-size.
				- `color` - for the text.

# CSS Layout

- Layout Theory
	- General Layout Theory
		- The fact that you can change the value of `display` for any element means that you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning without being concerned about how they will look.


	- Normal Flow
		- Starting with a solid, well-structured document that's readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage
		- The block flow direction is `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` by default.
			- margin collapse is on by default.
		- the inline level elements sit on the same line along with other inline elements as long as there is space on the parent block level element.


	- Flexbox
		- Modern Layout
		- Is a one-dimensionl layout
		- Flexbox allows you to:
			- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent
			- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height
			- - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
		- When an element becomes a **flex container** and its children become **flex items**.
		- Use `div`'s to be the flex container with `div.container{ display: flex;}`.
		- The block element's that are children of said `div` will be the flex items
		- The flex model - elements laid out as flex items have 2 axes:
			- Main Axis - is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the **main start** and **main end**.
			- Cross Axis - is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the **cross start** and **cross end**.
		- Nested Flex Boxes  -  a very common situation where you have a flex box inside another flex-box. The only trick here is to remember that the nested flex container is considered a flex item of the parent flex container.
		

	- Grids
		- Modern Layout
		- Is a two-dimensional layout
		- A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design elements.
			- A layouts in which our elements won't jump around or change width as we move from page to page
		- Typically havs **columns**, **rows**, and gaps between each row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as **gutters**.
		- Create  grids using lengths and percentages and [`fr`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex_value). The `fr` relative unit represents one fraction of the available space in the grid container to flexibly size grid rows and columns.
			- `fr` distributes available space.
		- track is **the space between any two adjacent lines on the grid**.
		- **Explicit grid** is created using `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows`.
		- **Implicit grid** extends the defined explicit grid when content is placed outside of that grid, such as into the rows by drawing additional grid lines.
			- tracks created in the implicit grid are `auto` sized, which in general means that they're large enough to contain their content.
		- Create as Many Columns as You Can in the Grid Container
			- Setting the value of `grid-template-columns` using the [`repeat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat) function, but instead of passing in a number, pass in the keyword `auto-fit`. For the second parameter of the function we use `minmax()` with a minimum value equal to the minimum track size that we would like to have and a maximum of `1fr`.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
  gap: 20px;
}
``````````
- 
		- Placing Things On Grids
			- Grid lines are numbered, beginning with the number 1
		- Nested Grids
			- Remember that the  neste grid container is a grid item of the it's parent grid container
			- use the value `subgrid` in the `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows` to inherit the parent grid's column tracks while adding a different layout for the rows within the nested grid.
				- You can also just not do that and define the grid columns and rows of the nested grid with no inheritance.
	
	- Floats
		- The floated element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content _floats_ around it.
		- Using floats to create entire layouts for web pages should be considered a legacy techinique.
		-  The element with the `float` property set on it is taken out of the normal layout flow of the document and stuck to the `float` property value side of its parent container. Any content that would come below the floated element in the normal layout flow will now wrap around it instead, filling up the space around the floated element.
		- While we can add a margin to the float to push the text away, we can't add a margin to the text to move it away from the float. This is because a floated element is taken out of normal flow and the boxes of the following items actually run behind the float.
			- Therefore the text of element's boxes of the normal flow stay the same... the float element is just on top of them, but the text of theses elements that are in normal flow are made to wrap around the float element.

	- Positioning - Positioning allows you to move an element from it's original place in normal flow to another location. Positioning doesn't create the main layouts of a page; it's more about fine-tuning the position of specific items on a page.
		- `position: absolute;` 
			- Allows me to create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page:  popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, etc.
			- if the absolute positioned element has  all it's parents positioning set to static, then the it will be contained by the **initial containing block**. [Identifying The Containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block)
				- The initial containing block contains the `html` element and has the dimension of the viewport. Therefore the absolute positioned element is positioned relative to the viewport and is displayed outside of the `html` element.
			- **positioning context** - which element the absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to.
				- change the positioning of the element that you want for the **positioning context** to `position:relative` and now the absolute positioned element will be repositioned relative to the `position: relative` element. As long as the absolute positioned element is an ancestor of the other.
			- `position: fixed;`
				- you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.
			- `position: sticky`
					- used to create a scrolling index where the heading of every section in the index is sticky positioned. Causing the headings of the index sections to sticky to the top of the viewport until another  heading takes its place as you scroll through the index.


	- Multiple-column layout
		-  lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper
			- Reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context due to the users having to scroll up and down.
		- The columns created by multicol cannot be styled individually.
			- the display of all columns can only be altered with: `column-gap` and `collumn-rule`
				-  the rule doesn't take up any width of its own. It lies across the gap you created with `column-gap`. To make more space on either side of the rule, you'll need to increase the `column-gap` size.
		- When a element spans across all columns the text in the columns will just jump across the element and continue after the element's box model ended.0
		-  When you turn your content into a multicol container, it fragments into columns. In order for the content to do this, it must _break_.
			- This breaking will happen in places that lead to a poor reading experience. To control this behavior, we can use properties from the [CSS Fragmentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fragmentation) specification

	- Responsive Design
		- `Responsive Design` an approach to CSS that is focused on making sure that your webpage can respond well to the multitude of different existent devices (mobile, desktop, etc).
			- It utilizes media queries to set breakpoints which are screen size media queries that allow you to change the whole layout of your webpage based on what is the size of the device's viewport.
				- A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g. mobile phones), then check for wider screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. Designing for mobile first is known as **mobile first** design.
			- You should define media queries with relative units.
			- Responsive sites are built on flexible grids, meaning you don't need to target every possible device size with pixel perfect layouts. You can change a feature or add in a breakpoint and change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad
			- The main weapons of Responsive Design are: flexbox, grid and multi-col layouts + media queries.
			- To ensure that embedded element's are never overflow its responsive container give them `max-width: 100%;`
			- Responsive Images, using the [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element and the [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) `srcset`, `media` and `sizes` attributes enables serving images targeted to the user's viewport and the device's resolution. 
				-  Using `<picture>` along with `max-width` removes the need for sizing images with media queries. It enables targeting images with different aspect ratios to different viewport sizes.
			- You can use media queries inside the media attribute on [`<source>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements nested inside [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)/[`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) elements to serve video/audio files as appropriate for different devices (responsive video/audio).
			- **Responsive typography** describes changing font sizes within media queries or using viewport units to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate. Increasing/decreasing font-size as the device's viewport is bigger/smaller.
				- If you define the font-sizes with `vw` units you don't need to worry about responsive typography, but the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the `vw` unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport. **Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone**.
					- If you add the `vw` unit to a value set using a fixed size such as `em`s or `rem`s then the text will still be zoomable, which solves the problem. `font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw)` for example.
			- `<meta name=viewport content=width=device-width,initial-scale=1>` - tells mobile browsers that they should set the width of the viewport to the device width, and scale the document to 100% of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-optimized size that you intended. Why is this needed? Because mobile browsers tend to lie about their viewport width. **So you should _always_ include the viewport meta tag in the head of your documents.**
	
	- Media Queries(Beginner)
		- media query syntax : `@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) { css rules go here }`
			- `media-type` - what kind of media is this CSS for? (`print, screen and all`)
				- the `print` value is for when the webpage is being printed.
			- `(media-feature-rule)` - media expression that must be passed in order to apply the CSS rules to the webpage.
				- `(orientation: landscape/portrait)` media expression that is passed if the device is in landscape/portrait orientation  respectively.
				- `(hover: hover)` - checks if the user can hover on elements,  which implies that they are using a pointing device and not a touchscreen or a keyboard to navigate through the webpage.
					- If we know the user cannot hover, we could display some interactive features by default. These features would be displayed when hovered otherwise.
				- `(pointer: none/fine/coarse)`
					- `fine` - user  is using a mouse or trackpad
					- `coarse` - user is using finger or touchscreen
						- For example, you could create larger hit areas if you know that the user is interacting with the device as a touchscreen.
					- `none` - user is using keyboard or voice commands
				- `(min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) or (30em <= width <= 50em)` - range width related expressions are very useful as well.
				
		- You can combine different media expressions with or, and and not operators to create more complex and therefore more specific media queries.
		- A **breakpoint** is the point in which the CSS of a media query is activate and applied to the webpage.
			- You should design breakpoints at the size where the content starts to break in some way. Perhaps the line lengths become far too long, or a boxed out sidebar gets squashed and hard to read. That's the point at which you want to use a media query to change the design to a better one for the space you have available.
			-  You can start with your desktop or widest view and then add breakpoints to move things around as the viewport becomes smaller, or you can start with the smallest view and add layout as the viewport becomes larger (mobile first responsive design). **Mobile First** is by far the best option.
				- The view for the very smallest devices is quite often a simple single column of content, much as it appears in normal flow. So there is not much you can do in terms of web page layout for them.
				- The priority should always be allowing the content to be readable at that viewport size. Then you increase the size of the viewport until the line lengths are too long and there is enough space for the navigation bar to be displayed horizontal rather than vertically. Then you should look forward to the moment where the viewport allows for the sidebar to be horizontal to the main element (in a new column perhaps), never sacrificing readability or clarity of course.
				- You should not only considered what CSS properties to change and add in each breakpoint, but also what properties you should remove from the breakpoint.
		- Flexbox, Grid, and multi-column layout all give you ways to create flexible and even responsive components without the need for a media query. It's always worth considering whether these layout methods can achieve what you want without adding media queries.

	- Legacy Layout - Do NOT LEARN THIS BUT READ IT
		- Table Layouts
			- table layouts are inflexible, very heavy on markup, difficult to debug, and semantically wrong
			- should only be used to support old browsers that lack support for Flexbox or Grid.
		- Only waste your time with this if you are determined to make your website compatible with older browsers


	- Supporting Older Browsers
		- Every website is different in terms of its target audience. Before deciding on an approach, find out the number of visitors coming to your site using older browsers. This is straightforward if you're adding to or replacing an existing website, as you probably have analytics available that can tell you the technology your visitors are using. If you don't have analytics or you're launching a brand new site, then sites such as [Statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/) can provide relevant statistics, which can be filtered by location.
			- For example, you can expect a higher-than-average usage of your website on mobile devices. Always prioritize accessibility and people using assistive technology
		- Always look for html elements/attributes/selectors/etc and CSS properties/etc that are not supported by your target browser so you can add fallback for them in your code.
			- When a browser doesn't recognize a new feature, it discards the declaration as invalid [without throwing an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/Error_handling#css_parser_errors). Because browsers discard CSS properties and values they don't support, both old and new values can coexist in the same ruleset. Just make sure to declare the old value before the new value so that, when supported, the new value overwrites the old value (the fallback).
			- If using vendor-prefixed [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) or new [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) a browser may not yet support, include the prefixed values within a [forgiving selector list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list#forgiving_selector_list) by using [`:is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) or [`:where()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where) so the entire selector block doesn't get [invalidated and ignored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list#invalid_selector_list).
		- You should not aim at making your website identical in all browser/viewports you should instead be serving a version of your content that is designed defensively, so that it will look great on modern browsers, but will still be usable at a basic level for all users no matter how they are accessing your content.
		- The content should be presented in a way such that it is accessible and readable even when images, videos, etc are not fully loaded since not everybody has good internet. _If you remove your stylesheet, does your content still make sense? The answer always has to be yes._
		- `(@supports (property: value)) {CSS rules}` - `@supports` is a media query to test if a browser supports a particular CSS feature. If yes then the CSS rules will be applied, if not then they won't.

- Practical Layout
	- General Layout Properties
		- `display` - determines what will be the elements layout.
			- Some Values: `block`, `inline` or `inline-block` and
				- `table` - designed for styling parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements and associate properties
				- `multi-column` - can cause the content of a block to lay out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.
		- `float` -  can cause block-level elements to wrap along one side of an element
		- `position` - control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. 
			- Some specific layout patterns rely on it.
			- Values: 
				- `static` positioning is the default in normal flow.
				- `relative` positioning moves the element taking it's original position in the normal flow as the offset.
				- `absolute` positioning moves an element completely out of the page's normal layout flow, like it's sitting on its own separate layer
					-  You can fix it to a position relative to the edges of its closest positioned ancestor (which becomes `<html>` if no other ancestors are positioned).
					- Allows you to create complex layout effects
						- Tabbed Boxes where different content panels sit on top of one another and are shown and hidden as desired
						- Off-Screen Information Panels that slide on screen with a button
				- `fixed` positioning fixes an element relative to the browser viewport, not another element.
					- Used to make the `header` or `nav` menu stick to the top of the viewport.
				- `sticky` positioning  makes an element act like `position: relative` until it hits a defined offset from the viewport, at which point it acts like `position: fixed`.
					- Actually the effect is FUCKING COOL.
			- You can cause elements to be fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
	- Flexbox Related Properties
		- Flex Container Properties
			- `display: flex;`
			- `display: inline flex`
				- makes the flex container an inline element of it's parent block level element.
			- `flex-flow` shorthand for:
				- `display-direction` - specifies which direction the main axis runs
					- Values: row(ltr), column(ttb), row-reverse(rtl), column-reverse(btt).
				- `flex-wrap` - stop flex-items from overflowing their container moving them to the next line.
			- `align-items` - controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.
				- `stretch` - make flex items fill the parent's space in direction of the cross axis
				- `center` - center them in relation to the cross axis
				- `flex-start`, `flex-end` - place flex items in the start/end of the cross axis.
			- `justify-content` - controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.
				- `justify-items` is ignored in a flexbox layout.
			- 
		- Flex Item Properties
			- `flex` - shorthand for:
				- `flex-shrik`](<- The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be specified separately using the [`flex-grow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) longhand property.
				- A second unitless proportion value, [`flex-shrink`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink), which comes into play when the flex items are overflowing their container. This value specifies how much an item will shrink in order to prevent overflow. This is quite an advanced flexbox feature and we won't be covering it any further in this article.
				- The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified separately using the [`flex-basis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis) longhand value.>)
			- `align-self` - used to override the `align-items` property set by flex container. Does the same thing as `align-items` but applies it to a specific flex item.
			- `order` - a unitless number that decides the position of the flex item in relationship to another. The default is 0, the lower the number the greater the flex item's priority so they come first.
			
	- Grids Related Properties
		- Grid Container Properties
			- `display: grid;` - changes layout to grid but gives you a one column grid, so your items will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal flow.
			- `grid-template-columns` - the amount of values == the amount of columns and the value in of itself decides  the size of the columns.
				- Use `fr` values to distribute column size proportionally to themselves.
				- 
			- `grid-template-rows` - obvious
			- `gap` - shorthand for:
				- `column-gap` - gap size between columns
				- `row-gap` - obvious
			- `grid-auto-rows` - sets the size of implicit rows and any other rows that have not been explicitly sized in the`grid-template-rows`
			- `grid-auto-columns` - obvious
			- `grid-template-areas` -  alternative way to arrange items on your grid.
				- Uses the `grid-area` values inside strings to determine the grid template:
```css
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer footer";
```
- 
				- Every cell of the grid must be filled
				- repeat name to span grid item across to cells
				- use `.` to leave a cell empty
				- the strings must form a rectangle.
				- Areas cannot be repeat in different locations
		- Grid Item Properties
			- `grid-column` - used to give a size to the implicit grid's tracks or a shorthand for
				- `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end` - what column line the grid item will start/end
					-  [`minmax()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax) function lets us set a minimum and maximum size for a track, for example, `minmax(100px, auto)`. The minimum size is 100 pixels, but the maximum is `auto`, which will expand to accommodate more content.
			- `grid-row` - used to give a size to the implicit grid's tracks or a shorthand for
				- `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end` - obvious
			- `grid-area` - specifies a value that will act as a placeholder for this grid item in the grid container's `grid-template-areas` property.
	- Floats Related Properties
		- `float` -  makes the element float and determines position of the float
		- `margin` - to push/adjust the content around it
		- `height`
		- `width`
		- On the element that follow the floated element in normal flow
			- `clear` - stops the following element from moving it's text up to fill the space left empty by the flow.
				- Values: `left`, `right`, `both` - clears floats that in the left/right of the following element or both.
				- But what if the float element is wrapped inside another box. In other words, what if the float element is a child element of a `div` and you want the element that follows that `div` to clear the float?
					- All you need to do is to give that `div` the `display: flow-root;` property  value which will create a [BFC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context) that consequentially will clear the float
	- Positioning Related Properties
		- `position` - defines type of positioning that will be use by `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `rigth` properties. Values:
			- `static` - puts the element into its normal position in the document flow. Its the default.
			- `relative` - will reposition the element taking it's normal flow positioning as the offset for `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties
			- `absolute` -  the element will sit on its own layer separate from everything else and from the normal flow layer. `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties will take each of the containing element sides as their offset.
			- `fixed` - _usually_ fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.  Exception:  one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block. (because its [transform property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) has a value other than _none_)
			- `sticky` -  allows a positioned element to act like it's relatively positioned until it's scrolled to a certain threshold, then it becomes `fixed`.
		- `z-index` - changes the layer stack order. Defining what layer comes on top of the other. Default value = 0. Selectors with greater `z-index` values will be on top of selectors with lower `z-index` values.
	- Multiple-column layout Related Properties
		- Multi-columns Container Properties
			- `column-count` - amount of columns the container will have
			- `column-width` - size of columns
			- `column-gap` - size of gap between columns
			- `column-rule` - sets the width, style, and color of the line drawn between columns
		- Multi-columsn layout Item Properties
			- `column-span` - defines how many columns the element will span across
				- value: `all` - makes element span across all columns.
			- CSS Fragmentation Module
				- [`box-decoration-break`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-decoration-break) - 
				- [`break-after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/break-after) - **specifies whether or not a page break, column break, or region break should occur after the specified element.**
				- [`break-before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/break-before) - **specifies whether or not a page break, column break, or region break should occur before the specified element.**
				- [`break-inside`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/break-inside) - **specifies whether or not a page break, column break, or region break should occur inside the specified element**.
				- [`orphans`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/orphans) -
				- [`widows`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/widows) -
	- Media Queries(Beginner) Related Properties
		- `min-width, max-width and width` are used to determine viewport tresholds to change the layout of the webpage as device viewport size increases/decreases.
