You will create a website with the intent of having people that will actually use it. This note is for you to write your ideas down and also decide the te [Technologies and What You Will Use Them For (ASP.NET)] you are going to use to create said website and for what are you going to use them.

First you need to figure out what group of people you will cater your website to, and what are there needs that will be solved by your website. Here is what I am thinking so far:
- A site for people that have very niche taste in music like breakcore, nightcore and so on. The site will allow users to find new music, post new music and also categorize the music since the whatever-core genres are being created right now in real time and it is very hard to classify the songs. The site should work like wikipedia where the community would be responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the genre and songs information. The site should also allow users to communicate between themselves.


Do not bother reading the rest if your website is not completely finished.


Next you will need to learn how will you market your website:
- Going on whatever-core genre subreddits and telling them that I am not trying to market my website but I just made a site that is catered to them and their desires/needs, I should tell them that I am one of them and that it would make pretty happy if they checked it out. "I am sorry if this is considered marketing, but I just made a site literally for people like us, that is why I want to post about it in this subreddit."
- Writing comments down in the youtube comment section similarly to my reddit posts


Before marketing you will need to go to mdn and learn how to own a domain. whatevercore.com would be a good one. The domain name needs to be catchy and simple.

You will need to learn how to make money from ads, donations, subscriptions and so on because otherwise you will not be able to sustain your domain price.
