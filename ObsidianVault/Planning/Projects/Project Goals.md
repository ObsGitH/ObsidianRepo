# CSharp

What you will not do (There is a lot you can do with C# so it is important to restrict myself): You will not focus onBlazor, you will not focus on Razor Pages. This is not set in stone, you might need to inject these things in the project here and there.

What you will focus on: MVC, LINQ, EntityFramework, SQL Server. All of these things should be pointed towards finishing your projects and making them better. In other words you should be always be working towards finishing projects in the time you dedicate to C#.

TODO:
1. Sucessfully learn how to create LogIn/Out and register functionality with Identity ASP.NET

3. Finish the List Appointment Project making it look the Views look pretty, unique and presentable
4. Build List Appointment Project in Release mode and put it in your Linkedin.
5. Play around and debug the ConversationSimulator project until it becomes ready for distribution and release it built in Release Mode
6. Fix the mess that is the BlackJack console project and then play around with it and debug it to make it ready for production then release it in release mode.
7. Then translate the BlackJack console game into a ASP.NET MVC Application. Dont forget to make it pretty and presentable as well with HTML and CSS.

# Rust
1. Finish blackjack game. Make it work, make it readable and make it fast

# LeetCode and DSAAs

There is not really a lot you can do here. Just solve LeetCode problems and maybe post your DataStructures that you've built yourself in the notebook to your github

# ArchLinux/Linux

1. I think it is a good idea to post the scripts that you've build for hyprland for example.
2. Another good idea is for you to make github pages to talk about how to configure hyprland and kitty to show that you  are an active member of the hyprland/linux community and to make you a better archlinux user.
3. I think that writing or re-writing the scripts with bash is a good idea to pretend thas you know how to program with bash LMAO
