1. Watching youtube in the middle of a study session
2. Checking Whatsapp messages in the middle of a task
3. The sounds from the TV,  my Mothers Mouth, Maid cleaning, Sister Listening to Music, doors closing
4. Listening to music while studying or coding. I need to buy something to block that noise.
5. Start tripping is a serious problem that gives me a lot of attention residue. I need to stop doing it altoghter or use it to my benefit.
6. Its clear that the reason why Im much more productive at night is because of the lack of attention residue.
