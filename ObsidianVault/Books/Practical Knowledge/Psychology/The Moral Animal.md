- “Multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.” Here “strongest,” as he well knew, means not just brawniest, but best adapted to the environment, whether through camouflage, cleverness, or anything else that aids survival and reproduction.

### Darwin Comes of Age
- The author makes a point to complain about a "double standard" in the Victorian and modern societies where promiscuous women were seen as low value but the man that engaged in promiscuity were not. The problem is that she later goes on to say the obvious out loud: that men and women are very different from each other. The case that she highlights are in sexual urges(way higher in men than women). She also is smart to recognize that feminists stopped lying about man and women being equal (they, obviously, always knew that was not the case since they are a movement led by upperclass and academic educated women) but dumb/deceiving enough to not mention that they dropped this lie when it stopped allowing women to acquire new unfair/unjustifiable systematical priveledges in western social justice warrior societies, maybe this is what she refers to when she says that seeing man and women as equal was "hurting women".
	- I also think it is truly incredible how, for USA women, everything revolves around women and women only, only their problems matter, double standards are only recognized when they benefit man, maybe when they benefit women (except for the most grave ones) and surely NEVER recognized when they are  bad for men. It never fails to amaze me how much prejudice modern united states citizens(even the most civilized ones like the author of this book) have against men. It has become to me a matter of fact that the modern USA is a sickly feminine society, much like nazi Germany was a sickly masculine society, we are talking about a completely feminized and misandristic country that has completely normalized prejudice towards men both sytematically(the laws revolving men and women are truly nothing lesser than disgusting in the USA. I know about cases of women getting away with cold blooded murder of their boyfriends in New York for example) and individually (the is no crime or moral/social punishment for women that commit misandry, the same cannot be said for men and misogyny. Would the author of this book be able to recognize this clear double standard?)
	- The author in a very indirect/sly way says that the fact men see whores as low value women is "disconcertingly stubborn", adding that "just because something is natural does not mean it is good or that it cannot be changed". How very convinient that she did not even try to consider why that might be, why are whores seem as low value by men? "Surely it is because human beings are stubborn. It is our responsability to fix it." said the author and called it a day.
- I think I can already tell the direction of this book and I am starting to understand the true intentions of the author. She wants to use Darwinism to social engineer society in a way that would be beneficial for her, like normalizing promiscuity in women for example. I am already very suspicious of the content of this book, it just does not seem like it was written by somebody with a sense of selflessness and fairness that would be necessary to ensure the validity of it's content
- Even do I've never heard about the term "Social Darwinism" before, my intuition immediately made me weary of said turn, good to know my senses are still sharp even though I am currently studying 8 hours a day.
- The direction this book is taking is making me furious already. I hope the author can procede in a more matter of fact way and refrain from voicing her opinions. I genuinely thought this was a science book... what a disappointment. This is more like a "using science to convince people to normalize what I want to be normalized" book so far.
	- Maybe I received incorrect information about the book. I guess I can't be mad at the author if she never intended to write a purely scientific book.
