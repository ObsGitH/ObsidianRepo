"There is nothing so stable in a race as the groundwork of its thoughts"

"Crowds are only powerful for destruction.  Their rule is always tantamount to a barbarian phase.  A civilisation involves fixed rules, discipline, a passing from the instinctive to the rational state, forethought for the future, an elevated degree of culture--all of them conditions that crowds, left to themselves, have invariably shown themselves incapable of realising"

" When the structure of a civilisation is rotten, it is always the masses that bring about its downfall."

"Without a doubt
criminal crowds exist, but virtuous and heroic crowds, and crowds
of many other kinds, are also to be met with.  The crimes of
crowds only constitute a particular phase of their psychology.
The mental constitution of crowds is not to be learnt merely by a
study of their crimes, any more than that of an individual by a
mere description of his vices."

Knowledge of the crowd became necessary so you will not to be ruled by the crowd.

It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology
of crowds that it can be understood how slight is the action upon
them of laws and institutions, how powerless they are to hold any
opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that
it is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they
are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them
and what seduces them.

men never shape their conduct uponthe teaching of pure reason.

## Chapter 1 General Characteristics Of Crowds -- Psychological Law Of Their Mental Unity

A psychological crowd is a crows that is more than just a group of individuals. It is a group of individuals that united all there thoughts and feelings into one direction (The Law of Mental Unity), therefore losing their individual conscious personalities that possesses provisional but determinable general characteristics, each of these general characteristics possessing particular characteristics that very according to the elements that compose the crowd and may change it's mental constitution. These people may or may not be in the same place.

Heterogeneous Crowd: crowd that possesses dissimilar elements.
Homogeneous Crowd: crowd that possesses similar elements(sects, castes, sex, race, class, etc)

all mental constitutions (individuals or crowds) contain possibilities of character change which
may be manifested in consequence of a sudden change of environment. Example: a shy unspoken guy that becomes an animal when watching his football club play and then goes back to normal when the game ends.

we shall concern ourselves more especially with such crowds as have attained to the phase of complete organization.  In this way we shall see what crowds may become, but not what they invariably are. The law of mental unity only applies to completely organized crowds.

Among the psychological characteristics of crowds there are some that they may present in common with isolated individuals, and others, on the contrary, which are absolutely peculiar to them and are only to be met with in collectivities

Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character, or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation. From the combination of heterogeneous elements of the crowd follows the creation of new characteristics that unique to the crowd and not found in the elements that compose the crowd, quite like H2O and H and O separately.

Our conscious acts are the outcome of an unconscious substratum created in the mind in the main by hereditary influences.  This substratum consists of the innumerable common characteristics handed down from generation to generation. Therefore the greater part of our daily actions are the result of hidden motives which escape our observation.

with respect to those unconscious elements which constitute the genius of a race that all the individuals belonging to it resemble each other, while it is principally in respect to the conscious elements of their character--the fruit of education, and yet more of exceptional hereditary conditions--that they differ from each other. Men the most unlike in the matter of their intelligence possess instincts, passions, and feelings that are very similar.
In the case of
every thing that belongs to the realm of sentiment--religion,
politics, morality, the affections and antipathies, &c.--the most
eminent men seldom surpass the standard of the most ordinary
individuals.  From the intellectual point of view an abyss may
exist between a great mathematician and his boot maker, but from
the point of view of character the difference is most often
slight or non-existent.
It is precisely these general qualities of character, governed by
forces of which we are unconscious, and possessed by the majority
of the normal individuals of a race in much the same degree--it
is precisely these qualities, I say, that in crowds become common
property. In the collective mind the intellectual aptitudes of
the individuals, and in consequence their individuality, are
weakened.  The heterogeneous is swamped by the homogeneous, and
the unconscious qualities obtain the upper hand. Which explains why crowds cannot do anything that demands high levels of intelligence. 

A group of people can only bring to bear in common on the work in hand those mediocre qualities which are the birthright of every average individual. How is it that these new characteristics are created in crowds?
- the individual forming part of a crowd acquires, solely from numerical considerations, a sentiment of invincible power which allows him to yield to instincts which, had he been alone, he would perforce have kept under restraint. A crowd being anonymous, and in consequence irresponsible, the sentiment of responsibility which always controls individuals disappears entirely.
- Contagion: In a crowd every sentiment and act is contagious, and contagious to such a degree that an individual readily sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest.  This is an aptitude very contrary to his nature, and of which a man is scarcely capable, except when he makes part of a crowd.
- A third cause, and by far the most important, determines in the individuals of a crowd special characteristics which are quite contrary at times to those presented by the isolated individual. an individual immerged for some length of time in a crowd in action soon finds himself--either in consequence of the magnetic influence given out by the crowd, or from some other cause of which we are ignorant--in a special state, which much resembles the state of fascination in which the hypnotised individual finds himself in the hands of the hypnotiser.  The activity of the brain being paralysed in the case of the hypnotised subject, the latter becomes the slave of all the unconscious activities of his spinal cord, which the hypnotiser directs at will.  The conscious personality has entirely vanished; will and discernment are lost. All feelings and thoughts are bent in the direction determined by the hypnotiser.

the disappearance of the conscious
personality, the predominance of the unconscious personality, the
turning by means of suggestion and contagion of feelings and 
ideas in an identical direction, the tendency to immediately
transform the suggested ideas into acts; these, we see, are the
principal characteristics of the individual forming part of a
crowd.  He is no longer himself, but has become an automaton who
has ceased to be guided by his will.

he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian--that is, a creature acting by instinct. He possesses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings, whom he further tends to resemble by the facility with which he allows himself to be impressed by words and images

The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that the crowd
is always intellectually inferior to the isolated individual, but
that, from the point of view of feelings and of the acts these
feelings generate, the crowd may, according to circumstances, be
better or worse than the individual. All depends on the nature of the suggestion to which the crowd is exposed.

Doubtless a
crowd is often criminal, but also it is often heroic.  It is
crowds rather than isolated individuals that may be induced to
run the risk of death to secure the triumph of a creed or an
idea, that may be fired with enthusiasm for glory and honour.


## Chapter 2 The Sentiment And Morality Of Crowds

IMPULSIVENESS, MOBILITY, AND IRRITABILITY OF CROWDS. The impulses which the crowd obeys are so imperious as to annihilate the feeling of personal interest-- Premeditation is absent from crowds--Racial influence.

CROWDS ARE CREDULOUS AND READILY INFLUENCED BY
SUGGESTION.  The obedience of crowds to suggestions--The images
evoked in the mind of crowds are accepted by them as
realities

THE EXAGGERATION AND INGENUOUSNESS OF THE SENTIMENTS OF
CROWDS.  Crowds do not admit doubt or uncertainty, and always go
to extremes--Their sentiments always excessive

4.  THE INTOLERANCE, DICTATORIALNESS, AND CONSERVATISM OF CROWDS. --The momentary revolutionary instincts of crowds do not prevent them from being extremely conservative--Crowds instinctively hostile to changes and progress.
5. The Morality of Crowds: may be much higher or much lower than that of the individuals composing them.
