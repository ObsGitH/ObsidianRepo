Rust Blackjack:
1. Finish the implementation of the game. DONE
2. Debug the game (make it work). Always think about edge cases.
3. Adjust the print messages throughout the game so the players can have a good experience (make it pretty)
4. Try to learn about rust best practices to optimize your program as much as possible (make it fast)
5.  Refactor the code to make it as readable as possible (make it readable/ make the code pretty)
	1. This would be a good time for you to understand Clean Code, Code Smells  and other retarded "Best Practices" (remember the only best practice is code compression)
		1. Remember that the real structure of code is sequential, therefore the most efficient way to write code is sequentially. Write the code if the code starts to repeat turn it into a funtion, if you start to use the same variables together over and over than turn those variables into fields of a class and so on. (I call this Sequential Compression Programming) 



Start BlackJack MVC webapp.

1. Re-learn how to create a mvc application. DONE
2. Try to really understand what is going on and play around with it so you feel comfortable. DONE
3. If you have time play with razor syntax and bootstrap as well in order to spend less mental effort on this retarded markup  languages so you can focus on real programming. In Progress
4. If you still have time after that you should consider learning signal-r. Just learn what you need to use in your web app, usually these technologies are gigantic.
