In the context of Go, the statement that "the linker in the gc toolchain creates statically linked binaries by default; therefore, all Go binaries include the Go runtime" has several important implications for how Go programs are built, distributed, and executed. Let's break down what this means:

### Key Concepts

1. **Statically Linked Binaries:**
   - A statically linked binary includes all the libraries and dependencies it needs within the executable file itself. This contrasts with dynamically linked binaries, which rely on external shared libraries present on the system at runtime.

2. **Go Runtime:**
   - The Go runtime includes several critical components such as garbage collection, goroutine scheduling, memory management, and other standard library functionalities that are essential for running Go programs.

### Implications

1. **Self-contained Executables:**
   - Go binaries are self-contained. This means that once you compile a Go program, the resulting executable contains everything it needs to run, including the Go runtime and any other libraries it uses. This simplifies deployment because you don't need to worry about installing Go or any dependencies on the target system.

2. **Ease of Distribution:**
   - Distributing Go applications is straightforward. You can simply compile your application and distribute the resulting binary. Users can run the binary without needing to install additional software, making it ideal for cloud environments, Docker containers, and systems where you want to minimize external dependencies.

3. **Cross-compilation:**
   - Go's toolchain makes it easy to compile binaries for different operating systems and architectures. You can compile a Go program on a Linux machine for Windows or macOS, and the resulting binary will run on the target system without needing Go or any other runtime installed.

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Statically linked binaries can potentially start up faster because they don't need to load shared libraries at runtime. However, they may be larger in size compared to dynamically linked binaries because they include all dependencies.

5. **Security and Stability:**
   - By including all dependencies within the binary, you reduce the risk of issues arising from incompatible or missing library versions on the target system. This can enhance the stability and security of your application.

6. **Go Runtime Features:**
   - The Go runtime provides important features such as garbage collection and goroutine scheduling. These features are built into every Go binary, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of compiling a simple Go program and creating a statically linked binary:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

To compile this program into a binary:

```bash
go build -o hello
```

The resulting `hello` binary is a statically linked executable that includes the Go runtime and can be run on any compatible system without requiring Go to be installed.

### Cross-compilation Example

To compile the same program for a different operating system and architecture, such as Windows on an AMD64 architecture, you would use:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hello.exe
```

The `hello.exe` binary can then be executed on a Windows system without needing any additional setup.
