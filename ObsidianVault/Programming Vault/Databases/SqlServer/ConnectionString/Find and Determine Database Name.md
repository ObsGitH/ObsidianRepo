To determine the name of the LocalDB instance in the connection string of an MVC application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check LocalDB Instances**:
    
    - Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
    - Run the command `sqllocaldb info`. This command will list all LocalDB instances installed on your system.
    - Look for the instance name in the list. By default, the instance name might be something like `MSSQLLocalDB`.
2. **Use SQL Server Object Explorer (Visual Studio)**:
    
    - Open Visual Studio.
    - Go to `View` > `SQL Server Object Explorer`.
    - In SQL Server Object Explorer, expand the `(localdb)` node.
    - Look for the LocalDB instance name. It should be listed under `(localdb)\Instances`.
3. **Check Registry (Advanced)**:
    
    - Open the Registry Editor by pressing `Win + R`, typing `regedit`, and pressing Enter.
    - Navigate to the following registry key:
        
        sql
        
        Copiar código
        
        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Installed Versions`
        
    - Under this key, you'll find subkeys corresponding to each installed version of LocalDB. Look for the subkey that corresponds to the version of LocalDB you're using (e.g., `11.0` for SQL Server 2012 LocalDB).
    - Within the subkey, you'll find a value named `InstanceAPIPath`. The name of the LocalDB instance is typically part of this value's path.

Once you've determined the name of the LocalDB instance, you can use it in the connection string of your MVC application. Typically, the LocalDB instance name is specified in the connection string using `(LocalDB)\InstanceName` format. For example:

`Server=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;`

Replace `MSSQLLocalDB` with the name of your LocalDB instance. This connection string format is commonly used in Entity Framework or ADO.NET connection strings within MVC applications.
