1. Never try to memorize methods and their parameters (you can always look their signatures in your IDE)
2. Just take the important things out of the web pages and copy them here in obsidian. As you go through these notes again you will find easier and easier ways to summarize what you have learned
3. Remembering classes and namespaces together with what they do is  worth it sometimes. (this is not always true, the explanation of the classes and their names are in your IDE as well, but just knowing them of the top of y)
4. More than anything, YOU NEED TO COPY EITHER "HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE" OR NEW CONCEPTS to obsidian. Hidden knowledge in this case would be knowledge that is hard to find or come by.
5.  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING ASK CHAT GPT
6. If you are not understanding the code just run the code on Visual Studio
