The methodoly consists on a 2 period system on any given phase of a project: strategy,  idealization, implementation, etc.

## Period Of Expansion
In the period of expansion people will add items to the the project phase without any discrimination. All ideas will be accepted and recorded.

Example: In the implementation phase people think of frameworks to use for the fronted and the backend and they come up with the solution: C# (ASP.NET) for backend, React for fronted, Rust for backend.

## Period Of Contraction
In the period of contraction people will eliminate items based on human and material constraints of the group/company.

Example: Rust is eliminated since there is only one person on the backend team that knows the language.

## Repeat
The process can be repeated endlessly until the team is satisfied with the outcome.

## Methodology Characteristics
- General purpose methodology -> applicable to any area/phase of the project
- Simple -> repetitive phases of addition and removal of items.
- Fluid -> the items can be endlessly updated due to the repetitive nature of the method.
- Scalable -> can be applied to the most macroscopic and microscopic areas/phases of the project
