# Common "Edge" Cases

- What if the data structure is empty
- What if there is only one element in the data structure
- What if the operation has to be done to the element in the beginning of the data structure
- What if the operation has to be done to the element  in the end of the data structure
- What about the elements in the middle of the data structure.
# Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
	- iterate through the data structure one element at a time
	- O(n)
	- Disadvantages
		- Slow for large data sets
	- Advantages
	- decent/fast for medium/small data sets respectively
	- Does not need to be sorted
	- Useful dor Data Structures that are incapable of random access (Linked Lists)
