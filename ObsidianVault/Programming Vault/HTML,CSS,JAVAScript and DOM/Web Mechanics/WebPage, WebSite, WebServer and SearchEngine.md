Most are a collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site." Note that it is also possible to have a _single-page website_: a site that consists of a single web page which is dynamically updated with new content when needed.

[web server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#web_server)

A computer that hosts a website on the Internet. "Hosting" means that all the _web pages_ and their supporting files are available on that computer. The _web server_ will send any _web page_ from the _website_ it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request. "My web server is not responding", it means that multiple websites on that web server are not available. usually people say website and webserver interchangibly which is a big mistake.

[search engine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#search_engine)

A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser.

A **_browser_** is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages; a **_search engine_** is a website that helps people find web pages from other websites. The confusion arises because, the first time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's homepage. This makes sense, because, obviously, the first thing you want to do with a browser is to find a web page to display. Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine).
