I am pretty intelligent, but I'm losing the spark to study and work hard. I am getting lazier and more and more distracted. What should I do?


- THE BEST ANSWER
	I read a lot of answers here, all seem to be tried and tested methods for themselves, all seems to be their ‘personal experiences’. Something personal, works only to that person.

	I’ll tell you from psychological perspective. [This must help! Have you ever seen an in-disciplined psychologist?] I’ll use simple terminology as I am not a professional psychologist, but read many books on the same.
	
	You cannot lift 100kg with bare hands, but you can lift it easily by using lever and fulcrum; similarly don’t work hard, use a hack, a hack to trick your mind, so your mind directs your body to work in your favor.
	
	Let’s first discuss why a person seems to possess a set of characteristics? What makes the character(s) of a person? What determines whether a person is lazy or active/self-disciplined, focused or distracted, frustrated or calm, angry or happy, etc.
	
	On physical level, we all are built same, everybody’s body functions in the same way, however the intensity of those functions differ, the amount of hormones and type of hormones differ. A hormone is responsible for a particular emotional state in humans. A person with elevated cortisol level will feel stressed all the time, that will feel hungry most of the times, will eat a lot of sweet things; a small sorrow or unpleasant thing will make this person frustrated easily. During periods, women get frustrated very easily, it’s hormonal. So either we inject/take chemicals that govern the regulation of hormones, to always remain in good mood, focused, alert and energetic.
	
	This seems easiest, that’s why many become drug addicts, they become alcoholic, resort of weed and other psychedelic drugs. I have seen doctors who don’t feel confident in operating the patient without having at least 2 pegs of alcohol. I have seen actors/singers/dancers who can’t act and perform without taking alcohol. This is where it becomes harmful, this method is easiest, quickest but addictive, once mind learns to operate normally in a particular chemical environment, it adapts to it and then can no longer operate normally, in normal (without drugs) conditions. So resorting to drugs, is addictive, let’s drop this idea, or keep it very very moderate, strictly. There are other drug free techniques to trick your mind to secrete and regulate the right hormone, to induce desired emotional state, more on this later, under resolution section.
	
	Our body does what the brain directs it to do, even if it’s a physical task, brain has a significant role to perform. Brain tells a particular muscle, its limit to lift weight, how long that weight can be kept lifted or do other tasks (= known as stamina). Under hypnotic state bodybuilders cannot lift even lighter plates, because their mind stops them to do so.
	
	We have total 21 senses or so (sense of balance, sense of temperature, etc), but lets talk about 5 major senses for now. We see something, and mind processes the information based on pre-conditioned interconnections of neurons and then directs other body parts to take an action, for example, you see emotional scene and cry; you see eatables and your mouth starts watering; you see erotic romantic scene and you feel aroused. There’s a particular neural interconnection in your brain to process each type of information and direct other body parts to take actions. These neural interconnections are just like software programs, which are designed to perform a particular piece of information, in a particular way. You don’t cry on seeing romantic scene; you don’t feel hungry on seeing sad scene; you don’t feel aroused on watching eatables or recipes of dishes. Because mind processes different information differently based on conditioning and take different actions (= output).
	
	So to change the output that brain gives out, you can either change the input (limit information that goes into mind) or change the program — neural pathways. The former method is about practicing “self control/overcoming temptations” and later is called Pavlovian conditioning, more on the two methods later.
	
	Our brain has mirror neurons, which fire up, when we are merely watching something in action. So if you are watching two people dancing, your brain is making the neural pathways as if you are dancing yourself, and if necessarily, you can also dance exactly the same way, without practicing it yourself, so when we watch something in action, our mind thinks we are actually doing it.
	
	Ever went to gym, why they always play workout music? Why do meditation centers always play calming or trance music? Because music is input for ears, what we hear goes into brain and processed differently and body reacts differently to different music.
	
	Where from thoughts come into our mind? And why do we think two much about it? We subconsciously observe visual/auditory information from our environment and think about it, and then next day, we observe other information and start thinking about it and most of our thoughts repeat from previous days. So to restrict our mind from thinking too much, either we can limit our exposure to our environment (become selective in what you watch/hear, whom you meet, what you do) or learn to make our mind ignore all the input it gets through sensory organs, more on this later.
	
	Why do we think too much about thoughts that come to our mind?
	
	Thinking and contemplating on a subject or thought is the learning mechanism, through which humans learn and find solutions, you think deeply only about those subjects which you are insecure or passionate about. If you are not insecure and passionate, your mind will ignore those thoughts and move on to others. So feed your body with lot of protein and vitamins B-12, actually B entire group, so your nervous system works perfectly and remain calm, a calm mind is neither insecure, nor passionate. Passion is another form of insecurity, you are never passionate about something which won’t give you anything ever. Think deeply.
	
	HOW TO TRICK YOUR MIND so it directs your body in your favor:
	
	1. First things first, make sure and give special attention to the amount of protein in your diet. Protein makes your mind calm, and keeps your body energetic.
	2. Regular Cardio workout, will make your body absorb the protein you take and make it usable. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768113/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768113/ "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov")
	3. Listen to workout music to always remain active, you’ll fall asleep less and calming and soothing music before going to bed, don’t listen to vocals. Learn to play an instrument if convenient, it’ll improve your emotional intelligence too. [The psychological functions of music listening](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741536/ "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") [Music, memory and emotion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776393/ "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov")
	4. Watch movies where people are shown to study vigorously, visualize yourself studying for hours, this tricks your mind to think that you are actually studying and will start making programs (neural pathways) to make a habit of studying.
	5. When you are feeling under-confident, stand and expand your body, stand erect for 5 mins, this will secrete dopamine hormone which will reduce the level of cortisol and you’ll start feeling confident. This is called power posing.
	6. [Choice Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture "en.wikipedia.org"): Put only pertinent visuals in your room, put posters of scientists who studied more, paste PERT chart for your goals, when eyes see something pertinent, the mind will process it and your body will work towards what eyes see regularly.
	7. Paste on walls, in front of your study tables, SUCCESS, WEALTH, TENACITY, RESILIENCE; whenever you eyes see these, your mind will think over it and change your believe system.
	8. If you are studying late night and feeling sleepy, no need to work hard on yourself, no need to control your sleep, simply pick a chewing gum and start chewing the gum, your mind won’t let you sleep, as long as you’ll be chewing gum. [Effects of chewing gum on mood, learning, memory and performance of an intelligence test.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356310 "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") [Chewing can relieve sleepiness in a night of sleep deprivation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11382890 "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") Chewing gum will also regulate your weight and result in weight loss, how many fat guys have you seen chewing gums?
	9. When you feel sad, hold a pencil horizontally between your tooth, your mind will think you are smiling and will secrete appropriate hormones to make you feel the happy.
	10. Meditate to calm your mind, and stop watching porn, it affects memory and other cognitive functions, such as analysis. This is because watching porn reduces the size of hippocampus and it is responsible for memory, cognition, analysis. Meditation increases the size of hippo-campus.
	11. This is very important, don’t meet loosers, be with good, studious people always. To be in good company, you can join Art of Living camps in your area, you’ll be surrounded by good optimistic people there.
	12. See a doctor, many a times the cause of lethargy is lack of hemoglobin in blood, if that’s the case, doctor will advise you to eat beet or its juice a lot.

	There are a lot of tricks, you need to study entire books for them, putting everything here isn’t possible.

- First Anwser:

	Very interesting question because I totally relate to this.
	
	Was the same situation for me back in 2012.
	
	Same as you, I felt something must be done, but I didn’t really want to do the real thing….study!
	
	I once actually felt that this some kind of disease, and I started complaining about various illnesses like headaches, backache, the eyes going blurry, the cold skin etc.
	
	Once a doctor came to our clinic for a check-up at school. I thought, let’s ask him how to cure my disease. I infact ran ahead of the other boys so that I could be the first one in class to get my checkup done.
	
	I went to the most senior guy in the team, and he checked my vitals. I waited for him to finish his tests, and then ask me about any personal issues.
	
	But he didn’t. He started sending me away. Then I stopped him and told him about my symptoms, and asked him what kind of illness I had. He listened very carefully and made notes. Then, he said that I was free to go.
	
	I got frustrated and said “Can you tell me what the problem is? I can’t go on any longer like this. I have to achieve so many things more, I can’t be fighting this illness forever. Please help.”
	
	He smiled nonchalantly and said “That’s the problem of your mind, and you’re procrastinating. The only medical problem you have is that your teeth have little extra calcium than usual, so you should visit a dentist and start brushing properly with milder toothpastes.”
	
	When I left that place, I realized one thing. Everything is a game of our minds. When we are lazy, we would not want to move a pen by an inch. But when we want to, we could climb Mount Everest multiple times or start the next big thing in the tech industry.
	
	So its down to whether you still remember what you’re trying to achieve. If you’re not feeling the vigour, it’s because you don’t know the value of what you want. If you do know the value of what you want, and still aren’t able to focus, it means you have something more valuable that you really treasure, and that you’re in the wrong association required to achieve this task.
	
	I loved airplanes for a long time. A frequent watcher of any air related serials/movies. It really gave me the high to see a plane takeoff. Later my parents counseled me and said “Do you remember your love for planes? Do you remember your desire to work with them for the rest of your life? Then find the link between what you want to achieve and what you like!” That’s when I came to know about aerospace engineering and all the industries that work in this domain and the variety of engineers they recruit.
	
	Just knowing this gave me the teeth I needed to continue. I further tried to push myself into groups of people who seriously wanted to win at the exam (not just clear it). I started going to teachers and learning from them on a one-to-one basis. I sat extra hours in my coaching institute instead of home to prevent distractions from the bed and TV. I joined a camp just before my board exams to push forth and prepare for the exams up ahead.
	
	I didn’t make it to IIT, but the journey was worth it. I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn’t really matter. What matters is whichever institute you go to and whatever you decide to do for the rest of your life, DO YOUR BEST, in the words of my favorite english teacher. Don’t let mediocrity control you. The result isn’t the ultimate source of happiness or success; the journey is. I learnt newer things; resilience and determination now come much easily to me and has contributed to my success in a big way.
	
	So when you get up everyday, have a shower, say your prayers, be grateful for how much your parents and friends care for you, and knowing that their happiness is in your happiness and your happiness is in achieving your goal, FIRE AWAY AND DON’T LOOK BACK. Because, one day, some junior will be in a similar position as you are and will post a similar question on quora, and you will be chuckling at how tiny things can be the source of great tension, and will remember all those wonderful days you spent working towards your dream, and will start typing out a much longer answer than mine, at the dead of night, knowing well that in the end, all will be better.
	
	EDIT: Got several requests from upvoters to talk about where I am now. I haven’t decided yet, but I do have admits from Cornell, Columbia, GeorgiaTech, UMichigan Ann Arbor and UC Berkeley for my MS. I will be heading to one of these places in 2017 fall. Thanks for so many upvotes!

- Second Answer
	I’m jumping in to answer because your case seems quite familiar.
	
	Almost same thing happened to me when I was in 11th or 12th. Everyone I met had the impression that I’m intelligent but that never came up in studies.
	
	In twelfth class I could literally see the time flowing out of my hands and me doing nothing in it. I was watching myself waste myself. I did once decide to take control over proceedings and turn my life around.
	
	Had a bad luck. I got ill (jaundice) just after a few days when things started to change. And it stayed for 6 months.
	
	I scored 73% in board. Neither did I score good in AIEEE or IIT JEE because you cannot clear these exams with JUST YOUR INTELLIGENCE!
	
	You know I really don’t believe in our education system but still I attempted these exams because at that time as well as now, I am in the system and only way out is through it’s ways. You can have some deviations but going all the way your way won’t be wise.
	
	And by the word ‘clear’ I really mean clear with a good score. Which can fetch you a good college.
	
	But was it just my laziness? there was a bit of bad luck too, isn’t it?
	
	But, DID IT MATTER IN THE END?
	
	I JUST HAD MY MARKS IN MY HAND!!
	
	It really doesn’t matter what happened, what could have been the possible reason, your laziness, your bad luck, or you were ill during exam, or you were kidnaped, or you died in an accident! Just think once “Does it really matter??”
	
	IN THE END NOTHING MATTERS! EXCEPT YOUR MARKS!
	
	This is something I realized when all my friends were getting admission in NITs and IITs and I had to look some government college that will take me.
	
	Everyone lost hopes on me. Specially my parents. I said continuously to my father that I will improve just let me drop one year. But he was right on his part. He said you had enough chances to prove yourself. “ bas bolne se kuch nahi hota ki ham ye kar lenge vo kar lenge… jo karna tha vo already kar chuke ho… time ja chukka hai!”
	
	On the last day when I had to post the admission form of some college, I firmly refused that I WILL NOT GO THERE AT ALL. I WILL DROP THIS YEAR AND PROVE MY DECISION RIGHT.
	
	Somehow he was convinced and I dropped an year. And here are few things that I did next:
	
	- I was a facebook addict till then. My average time at fb was 12–14 hours. There was internet connectivity at my home. then I decided not to ‘OPEN’ fb till 2nd june. That was the date of JEE Advanced 2013. ID was active whole time ( I didn’t deactivate it just to challenge my will power) and there was net at my home all the time with no one to ask me what i’m using anytime. And I did open fb on 17th july the day my coaching was starting and then on 2nd june.
	- Did a thorough study where my time was going. And the single major thing was “thinking” about things. Random things, research, procedures for doing anything, all the things in the world. I had to stop it at any cost. I set up reminder at every 5 min to check whether I was on track or not. And it did mostly eliminate the problem (though after JEE I realized it wasn’t a problem at all it just needed a good direction)
	- Made targets for everyday and no matter what you have to complete them everyday. Doesn’t matter how badly it annihilated my schedule ( I planned to sleep at 2 am and sometimes to follow the preplanned targets, I had to sometime sleep at 5 am!)
	- This did keep me busy and also reduced my time wastage over thinking purposelessly
	- Started study. I remember me asking myself a question at every minute of my starting time when my study schedule discipline every thing was disrupted like “ snacks or study?”, came from coaching, “rest or study?” had to wake up at 8, its 8, now “ wake up or sleep 10 more minutes?”
	
	Answer came somewhere from 2 things:
	
	1. why you started?  
	    remember the time when you started preparation. what was your condition.
	2. THE END  
	    In the end, “ what will matter?”  
	    will your sleep?  
	    will your rest?  
	    will your time wastage or inability to study due to any reason?  
	    will anything?
	
	actually nothing matter just one thing will matter: YOUR MARKS
	
	You know, I’m still at NIT Jalandhar and its not the best college in India.
	
	why that happened?
	
	Doesn’t matter!
	
	I had my problems. I won’t share them here. Because they don’t matter. They never did. all that matters is already in front of everyone.
	
	I hope that helps in some way or another.

- Third Answer
	RUN!

	I usually just scroll down and read answers on quora but when I came across this question, I was compelled to share my experience hoping that it might help someone.
	
	Three years ago, I was in a similiar condition. I had become quiet, lethargic and dull. I had lost interest in almost everything I found pleasure earlier. I felt guilty for laughing. I had become very quiet with almost negligible conversations with family or friends. I made study plans and set deadlines but I always failed(which led to further guilt and remorse). The entire day was spent scrolling facebook, instagram and youtube. I had no routine, discipline or control in my life. I had become a master procrastinator. I found relief in sleep.
	
	I read some motivational books, watched related videos. Nothing helped.
	
	However what changed my life was one simple activity: RUNNING.
	
	With a lot of help and strictness from one of my closest friend, I started implementing this change. I started waking up in the morning everyday and went running. It was the hardest yet the most magical thing I've ever gone through. Waking up early everybday, running everyday and maintain the discipline was a challenge. Slowly the change was visible. I could feel my body changing, my brain changing, my skin glowing. I started smiling naturally. I was full of positivity. After a long time in my life, I was happy and confident.(like really happy with me and my life). I was focusing on my studies again. Life was good again.
	
	It is only now that I realize the pathetic quality of my life I was leading before. Everyone deserves a happy and healthy life and the key to it(according to me) is discipline.
	
	I run everyday in the morning now to manifest discipline in my life and life has been wonderful since.
	
	I hope I could help:)
	
	I wish you a happy and healthy life!
